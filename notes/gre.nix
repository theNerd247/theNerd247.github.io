### Process

''(list 
  [ "Verify Understanding"
    "Personal Response"
    "Decide On Position"

  ]
)''

Below is the recommended process for performing the analysis
and generation of evidence for my claim:

''(digraph "issueAnalysisProcess" ''

  node0 [label = "Core Issue / Understanding"]
  node1 [label = "Define Terms, Assumptions & Predicates"]
  node2 [label = "State My Opinion, Assumptions & Examples"]
  node3 [label = "Give Counter Arguments and Responses thereof"]

  node0 -> node1 
  node1 -> node2
  node2 -> node3 
'')''

### Successful Characteristics

''(list 
  [ "Give Examples"

## Argument Analysis

Goal: Consume an Argument

### Process

''(list
  [ "Read / Understand"
    "Analysis"
    "Alternate Explanations"
    "Evidence to weaken/strengthen"
    "What Changes I Would Make?"
  ]
)''

Below is the process for deconstructing a given argument

''(digraph "argumentAnalysisProcess" ''

  node0 [ label = "Evidence Declared"]
  node1 [ label = "Implicit Evidence"]
  node2 [ label = "Assumptions Made"]
  node3 [ label = "Argument Structure"]
  node4 [ label = "Altenative Explainations"]
  node5 [ label = "Potential Strength Effecting Evidence"]
  node6 [ label = "What Changes to Structure, Evidence, etc to improve"]

  node0 -> node1
  node1 -> node2
  node2 -> node3
  node3 -> node4
  node4 -> node5
  node5 -> node6
'')''

Assumptions are claims that have little/no supporting evidence.

## Verbal Reasoning


* tests understanding of English grammar.

Tips for reading:

  * Distinguish between:

    * main and supporting ideas
    * pursuasion and declaration
    * hypothetical/speculative vs committed points
  * transistions between ideas
  * relationship between different ideas
    
    * contrasting vs consistent
    * one supports the other
    * one explains another
    * one an application of the other

## Areas of Improvement

* Common word definitions
* identifying transitions as important
* relating key words to answers

* Reading comprehension

  * Not blanking out during reading a question
  * Not thinking of related subjects while reading a passage (focusing on the
    topic at hand).
  * Reading the passage and question and answers more than twice.
  * Try and avoid "understanding" the passage and more the relatonships between
    parts of the passage.
  * Summarize long passages? I.e find the larger structure and then recurse
    into the smaller substructures.
  * Stick with gut answer
