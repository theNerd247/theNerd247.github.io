Dear Hiring Manager,

In light of globalization the ability to communicate is an attribute that
enables someone to thrive and No Red Ink, I believe, has this aim in mind for
the next generation. With my past experience from college to being a fullstack
developer I believe I would make a valuable member to the Haskell team at No
Red Ink.

Recently I finished an internship with Awake Security (now Arista Networks) as
a Haskell engineer. There I contributed to an interpreter for an in-house
language they developed. I also invented `conix` - a language that aims to make
writing technical documents easier - using the Nix programming language. While
working at Awake I was mentored by Gabriel Gonzalez - the author of the Dhall
programming language - in category theory, lambda calculus, and technical
writing.  There I grew a love for writing documentation and mathematical based
API design and construction.

Before Awake I was a full time instructor at a software engineering immersive
course where I brought students with no knowledge of programming to being
junior level engineers. It was a tough job - but I learned a lot about teaching
adults, writing well-designed code, and leadership.  I invented a course
scheduling language and curriculum management system which I wrote using
JavaScript and Nix respectively. I had a deep desire to see my students succeed
and spent many hours outside of work to improve curriculum and the
internal-tooling used by the myself and other instructors. This led to an
increase in the efficient use of the instructors time and more successful
students.

I have experience using Elm-lang - but mainly in smaller projects. One was a
check in system I wrote for my church to use during an Easter Egg hunt for
about 300 people. In the second project I taught a high-school student to
program with Elm-lang by creating a video game.

In joining No Red Ink I hope to grow and learn from other senior developers as
well as take part in peer mentoring. I value strong team communication and
support asynchronous workflows where developers can make efficient use of their
time. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon,

Noah Harvey
