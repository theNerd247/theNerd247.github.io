I am applying to Carnegie Mellon's Doctoral Computer Science program as my next
step towards a career in academics. I intend to study the foundations of
programming languages and how category theory can be used in the development
of programming languages.

Since I started programming I have been interested in what makes programs well
organized, bug free, and idiomatic. I believe that these three principals are
tightly coupled. I.e. bug free code tends to be well organized and contain
idiomatic APIs. Further, if a program has a mathematical model as its
foundation then it tends towards achieving the previously stated goals. I
believe that category theory gives a functional programmer a great tool for
reasoning about programs and constructing models to solve their problems with.

While in college I discovered Haskell and functional programming.
Inevitably I discovered Category Theory and the field of modelling programs
mathematically. I immediately started applying basic concepts like functors,
monads, semigroups, and monoids to my daily programming jobs in OOP languages.

By the end of college I was introduced to lambda calculus. I then became
fascinated with how functional programming languages were written and their
typing systems. After learning how to create eDSLs I began to see how programs
could be well written if eDSLS were used (example given?). From there I found
that Category Theory could be used as a formal reasoning system for writing
programs that were well defined in their behavior and thus have less bugs, and
naturally the code was well organized.

Over the last 3 years I have been reading research papers, Category Theory For
Programmers, and Benjamin Pierce's _Types and Programming Languages_. I have
also started writing an eDSL for bringing high-order logic to markdown. I used
categorical constructions as the basis for implementing the language. I have
also began work on a denotational semantics for modelling a language for
personal finances.

I spent a year teaching at a software engineering boot camp where I taught
introduction to web development, algorithms, and datastructures. While there I
discovered my passion for discovering new things and sharing them with others.
I learned the skill of teaching adults using non-traditional methods and
mentoring. I investigated better methods for writing ReactJS code.

I have also made continuous efforts to be mentored by others and privately
mentor others.
