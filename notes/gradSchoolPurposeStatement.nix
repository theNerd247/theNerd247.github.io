# Interests 

* Practical category theory for writing APIs and writing software (modelling?)
* Type systems?
* Writing interpreters
* Writing DSLs for domains
* Invertable Parsing
* Semantics?
* Programming language implementation with category theory as semantics
* Lenses

What do I want to learn?

  * Deeper applications of category theory and writing sound APIs
  * How writing a language works

How can I help the field grow?

  * A character based answer? -> curious, self-driven, etc.?
  * Current research I've done -> I haven't formally done any research...I'll
  need to get creative here...

What have I done to show I enjoy research?

  * Reading types and programming languages
  * Category Theory for programmers
  * other research papers

What other things have I done outside of STEM to show self-drive / community
influence?

  * Volunteering at my Church
  * Involvement with ministries with college students
  * Mentoring college students
