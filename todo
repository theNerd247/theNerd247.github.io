* pull in filterInline from pandoc-sidenote (will need to fork - or just copy
* code)
* change filenames of all md files to use a sanitized title found in the file
  (stupid 2016407.md is difficult to search when I want to edit)
* move ./static to ./md/static (safer for non-pandoc support)
* create a larger haskell program that merges pandoc-sidenotes and pandoc-tags
  and the lua filter into a larger filter (compbining algebras)
* write a haskell build program for handling the build process (maybe use
* shake?) 
* remove github repos as assets for css files
* add a search system to make it easy to discover links between notes
* write notes on:
  
  * System-F-ω (simply typed lambda calculus with polymorphism as ∀types.terms
    relation and high order kinds with argument size restriction).
  * Hindley-Milner type inference (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley-Milner_type_system)
