# Benefits of Functional Programming With EAQL
A DSL is a very specific language that aims to make encoding solutions to a
certain problem domain more intuitive. 

A person programs when they take any solution and "write it down". For
example a cook programs a cake by writing the recipe down. Recipes are
programs and executing a recipe is the making of the cake.

If encoding made is easy then creating solutions becomes easier. Not because
the problem is any easier to solve; but trying out new solutions takes
little brain power and time.

EAQL is a domain specific language for threat research and analysis. It was
designed to allow network security analysts to "write down their thoughts"
and automate executing them. For example:

```
```


Functional programming provides a universal backbone - a machine that generates
other langauges - for encoding human logic into a computer.  It makes it easy
to combine create solutions and combine them in an easy way.
