There's a big problem with the mathematical definition of the evaluation of
lambda calculus (see <2016404>).

```
x → x
λx.y → λx . y* | y → y*
(λx.y) z → y[z/x] | x ∈ FV(y), x !∈ FV(z)
```
Implementing the above can be a big pain, and really inefficient when we have
to deal with variable substitution: there's an implicit variable context that
is passed down the AST as we perform evaluation. By making substitution a part
of the object language we can solve some of the issues of making lambda
calculus more optimal to evaluate.
