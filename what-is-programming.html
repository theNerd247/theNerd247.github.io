<h1 id="what-is-programming">What is Programming?</h1>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>What is programming -&gt; FP makes dividing the problem and combining the solutions easier -&gt; Solutions to each problem can be expressed in its own language -&gt; Combining those languages makes it easy to combine the solutions. -&gt; Domain specific languages that can be combined together makes it easier to write total solutions to problems. -&gt; EAQL is one such language.</p>
<p>A program is an encoding of a solution that can be later recalled and executed.</p>
<p>The meaning of “encode”, “solution”, “recall”, and “execute” all depend on the context of the problem.</p>
<p>Programming is the act of creating a program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooking. The program is the recipe; the execution is the cooking.</li>
<li>Law. The program is the law; the execution are the sentences carried out by the law.</li>
<li>Doctors. The program are the textbooks on treatments; the execution is the diagnosis and treatment of patients.</li>
</ul>
