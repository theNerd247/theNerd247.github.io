Prayer is not a skill that is aquired. It is an act of intimacy with our heavenly Father. 

> When one prays their lives are still busy; but they develop a less busy heart.

Praying is like enjoying a good meal with God that is filled with honest emotions. 

The opposite of prayer is cynicism. You don't see God as a compassionate friend but just that - an uncaring unresponsive callous God. You don't merely lack faith. You lack relationship.
