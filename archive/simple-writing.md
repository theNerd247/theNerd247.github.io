Research papers are difficult to read. And I'm learning that it's not because I
am unintelligent or ignorant. It's that the author is a poor editor.

Here are a few tips for writing well[^1]:

  * Write in a manner that's easy to read aloud.
  * Include humans in your writing [3].
  * Tell a story; not a bunch of facts.
  * Place verbs as close to nouns as possible
  * Avoid paranthetical text in sentences [1].
  * Don't mangle ideas together. Sentences,  paragraphs, etc should have a
     ingle idea
  * Build up and then make a point; don't make your point and then hurry to 
    give its proof aftarwards. 
  * Make conclusions of sentences match subjects of following sentences [2].
  * State the obvious; but not "too obvious". - someone will thank you later.
  * Avoid technical words that only your colleges would know (jargon).
