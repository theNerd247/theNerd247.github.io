# Algorithm

1. Fold over the AST of a document and find all md-links. 
1. Filter links by target file exists relation.
1. Append list of empty links to todo list
1. Possibly verify with user?
1. Write todo list to disc.

# Purpose

This could be very useful in a workflow for keeping track of notes I'd like to
write, but haven't written yet. An autogenerated todo list would be nice.
Especially since I tend to bounce from topic to topic as I'm researching ideas.
