I've been using a Zettelkasten for a week and am noticing some huge reasons for
using it. As well as some principles for why making a Zettelkasten isn't the
same as making a personal internet.

A Zettelkasten is a personalized note taking system where:
  
  1. notes are taken on cards (physical or electronic); not notebooks
  1. each card has:

      * a title
      * a set of tags
      * a set of direct links to other other tags
  1. Contains only personalized content
A Zettelkasten's purpose is:

  * to record your thoughts to help organize them
  * to discover connections between your thoughts that would never have been
    made had your ideas weren't explicitly written down and tagged.
  * to reinforce things you've learned 
  * invest in your future work.
  * to discover connections between ideas that seem completely unrelated

This last point is important. I've seen the idea of creating per-topic
Zettelkastens or even linking Zettelkastens between multiple people. But here's
my response to these two ideas: they're unecessary and break the idea of a
Zettelkasten. Here's why:

  * Multiple Zettelkastens that are unrelated are pointless because they rid us
    of being able to discover connections between potentially unrelated ideas.
  * Per topic Zettelkastens that are connected form a...Zettelkasten! So by
    definition you can't have connected Zettelkastens.
  * Linking Zettelkasten's between multiple people is called...the internet.
    Think about it. A digital Zettelkasten is just a website with a search
    engine, tags, and links to other pages. Today we call mutliple websites
    that are interlinked the internet.
So the solution to these ideas? You should only have 1 Zettelkasten, period. It
should contain all your notes for every topic learn and idea you have. 

Your Zettelkasten should not be connected to other people. Why? Because your
Zettelkasten is your personal thought land. You should not be concerned with
writing notes in a way that others would understand. Heck, use pigpen to write
your own! By connecting to ther people's Zettelkastens your are forced to solve
the problem of interpersonal communication (and privacy for that matter) which
interrupts brainstorming and research. Save linking to other people for mediums
that are built for this such as blogs, research papers, and tweats.
