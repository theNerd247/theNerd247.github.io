[^1]Often I find that parenthetical statements are evidence that more thought needs
to go into your prose. Either the reader needs background information or you
want to dive deeper into a topic. Think of parenthetical notes as your child
interrupting you while you're talking; its impolite to distract a reader.

A few alternatives for using "-", ",...," and "(...)":

  * don't include them; they may not be that important afterall.
  * use foot/margin notes; give the reader the freedom to be distracted.
  * Add another, separate sentence or paragraph before or after the
    sentence; you may be brainstorming while writing and need to focus on
    one or the other.

[^1]: Drinking my own medicine - this note came about while writing [1]. I
  realized the footnote was becoming an article...so I refactored it.
