# Language is at the Heart of Mathematical Thinking

The definition of an abstract concept is the act of translating that object
into another more concrete language. For example the abstract concept of a set
is defined by using the language of containment (or inclusion): a set is an
abstract thing for which we can ask if something is included in that set.

```
                        Definition
Less Concrete Language -------------> More Concrete Language
```

So the big question category answer is: how do we formalize the idea of
"language" and how do we formalize the idea of definition. Categories are
languages and definitions are functors. The objects in a category are those
nouns in a language and the morphisms are the verbs. And a functor is a rule
for translating from one language to another.
