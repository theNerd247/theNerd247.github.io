# Intro

John 14:26, 1 Cor 2 - divine combustion. The Holy Spirit teaches us.

A depreseed man cannot go to the clown to be cheered up; he is the clown.
Christians put on a front. "I'm not depressed". Is it ok for a believer to be
depressed, discouraged, dispared, down?

Charles Spurgeon - the prince of preachers - had sever bouts of depression.
Martin Luther would go for weeks depressed. Paul, was depressed - see 1 Cor 1.

God gives us emotions! Deep emotions. Feeling the emotion is not wrong. But how
we deel with the emotion matters.

# Context

Psalms is divided into 5 sections. 

  1. 1-41
  2. 42-27
  3. 73-89
  4. 90-106
  5. 107-150
Each one ends with a doxology. 150 is a large doxology. No one knows why the
books were divided. The Mishrah says that it may relate to the Pentatuk.

"Maskil"
: I'm about to give you instruction on how to live! Pay attention!

# Run To God

"Dear Panting for Water"

Psalm 42:1

David is currently fleeing Jerusalem from his son Absolem. He longs - yearns -
to be back with his people and to be in the presence of God. 

When a dear is thirsty he will sprint full speed to some water. When arrives,
he goes head first into water forgetting everything around them. Whenever a
deer is in trouble he runs towards water. He develops a tremendous thirst. All
the running develops a strong thirst for water. When in drought conditions he
changes his daily patterns to be closer to water.

Seek God with ALL your HEART! Long to know Him personally. 

The last thing I do when I'm depressed is go to God. I feel bad. Suffering, and
pain was C.S Lewis's largest megaphone. It's when we're suffering that we give
in to God.

> If anyone is thirsty let him come to Me and drink and He will be satisfied.
> - John 7:37

Something becomes an addiction when we seek something other than God to fill
us. 

> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
> Matthew 5

Don't go to church, look at the menu, and never eat when you get home.

John 13. Jesus lives His life through us. We need to feed the new life we have
in Christ.

Nothing will give a lasting victory over depression than a right relationship
with God.

> Our hearts are restless until we find rest in You God! 
 
# Diet of Tears

Psalm 42:3-4

David is overwhelmed. The taunts of his enemy is bothering him; it's getting to
him.  He's remembering his past and mourning that he doesn't have it currently.

There are times when we experience great joy in Christ! But right now you maybe
like those that are struggle with depression. "MY life is so spiritually barren
that I could spit dust". This is how David feels. Psalm 42:5-6

# Acknowledge the Reality of the Depression

"despair"
: to prostrate one's self
: to bow down
: to crouch down - like a lion ready to pounce.

Emotionally David is on his belly.

David is acknowledging his depression! He readily admits to God that he's in
dispair.

Not all depression is a spiritual problem. There are physiological problems.
Hormones, aging, etc.

David pours out his soul to God. God can handle our depression and
discouragement.

> God I need you! I'm desperate.

It's ok to struggle and wrestle with these emotions. It's not ok to stay there.
We do a discervice to believers by telling them that they must always be happy.

_Be transparent_; it's Biblical therapy. Go to God on your knees and poor out
your spirit before God.

# Remember God's Unconditional Love of God

"Deep calls to deep". Your deep God calls to my soul (deep). Just as you call
forth the water when the seasons change you call forth my heart and remind me
of your loving kindness. 

In verse 8 He's using Jehovah which means that he's remembering His
undconditional love that God made with Israel.

> Don't let the giant of the circumstance determine the size of your God.

_Noah, how big is your God?_

# Decide to Trust God

Sounds simple. But what we mean is that we need to declare war on our doubts
and insecurities. 

Psalm 42:9-11 is similar to verse 5.

Before he talked to God about his depressed soul he talked to his depressed
soul about God. 

_Often we listen to ourselves instead of talking to yourself. Yourself is
talking to you! And often it's not good! David here instead of listening to his
feelings he reminds himself of God's nature._
