1. Follow a grammatical subject as soon as possible with its verb.
2. Place in the stress position the “new information” you want the reader to emphasize. 3. Place the person or thing whose “story” a sentence is telling at the beginning of the
sentence, in the topic position.
4. Place appropriate “old information” (material already stated in the discourse) in the topic
position for linkage backward and contextualization forward.
5. Articulate the action of every clause or sentence in its verb.
6. In general, provide context for your reader before asking that reader to consider anything
new.
7. In general, try to ensure that the relative emphases of the substance coincide with the
relative expectations for emphasis raised by the structure.
