`fⁿ | f :: a -> a` is defined as `f(f(f…f(x)` where `f` is applied `n` times to
x. The type of `f` is `fⁿ : (a → a) → (a → a)`

Here `x ∈ N`. But what if we changed the type of `x`? What if it were `R`, the
real numbers? My first intuition is that it would be somthing like nested
functions. Where each place holder represents a different level on which the
function is called.
