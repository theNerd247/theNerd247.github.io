# Intro

Romans 8:21

creation longs for God's salvation.

In this season evangelical Christianity is at the height of this false
teaching:

> An over-realized eschatology. If there is healing through the cross then we
> want health now; for by his stripes then we are healed. We should be able
> to name and claim our physical manifestation of God's healing now.

Romans 8:23

We groan within ourselves for God's adoptions as sons, the redemption of our
bodies.

## Realize There Will Be Suffering

groan
: we continue to groan (present active tense)

Paul is saying: the Holy Spirit is the down payment for something to come.

I will give Israel a heart of flesh and take away their heart of stone. Before
we came to Christ we had a heart of stone. If we have a heart of flesh then we
should want holiness. 

Righteousness
: To want to do what is right; obey the commandments of the Lord. 
; rightness
: Matthew 5 - "hunger and thirst for righteousness"

We have a difficult time doing this; we have an old nature - a sin nature that
draws us away from Christ to worldly things.

We physically don't want to get up early in the morning doesn't want to get out
of bed and spend time with Christ. But the spirit planted in us does.

When we come to Christ God gives us a vacuous stomach and we long to eat. But
to eat the hands (Holy Spirit) must move but the jaw (the flesh) does not open.

Romans 7:15

"Nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my [sin nature]".

v21. "the law of God" = The holy spirit.

The body I have doesn't want to cooperate with God.

Romans 8:15  "we've recieved the adoption as sons" but...Romans 8:21 - we're
waiting?

Adoption in the ancient world.

Patria potestas
: the father had absolute control over their children. But up to a certain age they had
a special ceremony. A robe the father placed on the child and he, the child, became a new
person. He is now a man, a fellow heir with is father. 

Romans 8:17-18

## There is more to salvation

We are completely saved when we trust Christ. But our bodies have not been redeemed. We await
the realisation of this within our physical selves.

Redemption
: agarazo - to buy a slave
: exagarazo - to buy a slave out
: apolatruo - to go to the slave market, buy a slave and subsequently free him.

[["salvation", "sanctification", "glorified"]
 ["justified", "acting out righteousness", "redeemed body"]
]
)''

''(dotDigraph "newbody" "Millenium --> eternity")''

eagerly
: actively! Not a passive waiting

## God Back To The Future For Strength

Remember when you trusted Christ? You knew you did not want to spend eternity
in Hell.  The fact that Christ would love you and give you eternity was in
comprehendable. He has eternity waiting for me! But over the years our flame
grows cold. We start out with the future in mind; before long we forget we are
to live with a mindset looking to the future. One day our body will be risen;
our minds wholed; our hearts healed. Like a couple waiting for the wedding
night; like a pregnant woman waiting to give birth. Are we like this? Do we
live with anticipation? How we live here determines the blessing we get in the
millenium. 

> We were created for another world
> _The Weight Of Glory - CS Lewis_

Psalm 17:15

## Application

1. Realize the exact truth of this world. He alone fills our soul vacuum.
  * What toys, jobs, success, relationships are you satisfying our life with?
  * If we think this is all there is to life then we'd be an empty vessel.

1. Remind yourselves who and what you are: A child of God! 

1. Your hope is a living confidence. Phil 3:20-21

_Like a deep sea diver who has to wear a suit because he wasn't made to live in
water; we wear a sinful body and we are not made to live in this world but with
Christ in the next._
