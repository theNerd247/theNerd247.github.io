# Intro

${ref}:28-30

How do I know that I'm saved?

Others fear that they have done something that causes us to lose our salvation
and live on eggshells.

v31.

"these things" refers to the same "things" in v32.

# I am assured by my love of God  

"those who love God" - this is not a warm fuzzy thing we get (not a spiritual
high).  This is evidence (proof) that we are saved. 1 John 4:19. God first
loved us, and then we loved Him. If I'm obedient to Him then I want to please
Him and that shows that I love Him. 

2 types of love in marriage:

  * One spouse is conditional in their love and the other constantly attempts
    to gain the approval of the other person.
  * The other type of love is the opposite.

${ref}:28,30

# Am I assured by God's call

There is indeed a call to ministry - however this is not the calling noted in
v30.

2 Peter 3:9

Universalism 
: everyone will eventually come to Christ.

Can we honestly I am what I am by God's grace? Are there things in my life that
can only be explained by the supernatural?

What are your interests these days? Is it to know Christ? Is it to participate
in the growth of God's kingdom?

What has made you what you are? Are you convicted by sin? Conviction is like
an annoying smoke alarm. 1 Thes 2:13

# I am assured by God's purpose for me

"foreknew"
: doesn't mean predetermine, predestine, or foreordination
: pros (before) * ginosko (knowledge)

"predestine"
: to markout set a boundary

God, before the foundation of the world, has marked out a plan of redemption
for us. For example, a soccer coach already determines what plays and team
movement is to occur and so he sets up practices to direct the team to do this.

${ref}:29 - Jesus was the first born of several brothers. We are conformed to
the image of Christ because we are brothers; we have the same DNA.

${ref}:30

# I am assured by my justification

3 things God could have done to address sin:

  * issue verdict leaving us hopeless (condem all)
  * comprimise justice and lower the standard
  * provide a means to forgive sinners

Romans 3:21-22

God doesn't grade our righteousness on a curve - infact there isn't even a
scale: it's a binary scale.

2 Cor 5:21

Justification doesn't mean "not guilty" but more: you are completely righteous
before God.

# Iam assured by my glorification

${ref}:30 - you are glorified. 

In ${ref}:18,21,23 Paul is talking about what will happen to us during the
millenial.

But in ${ref}:30 is a timeless statement - in God's plan it is already
considered done (modus ponens?).

# Application

* Go on facts not feelings
* This week think on this: Christ has a lot invested in you.... He is not
going to give up on you now. There's nothing you can do to make Him displeased.
