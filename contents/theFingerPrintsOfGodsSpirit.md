''# ''(label "title" "The Fingerprints of God's Spirit")''

# Intro

Many people are searching for purpose in life all the while they are missing
what is right in front of them - the Holy Spirit.

Imagine that God has given you a house while you are living outside. You
wouldn't turn this down would you? God is saying "Instead of looking for peace
from the world (cars, money, houses, spouses, tv, internet, pornography, etc.)
run to me! I have given you my Spirit! You simply need to activate me".

"exogesis"
: to interpret a text through a thorough analysis of the original author's
meaning of the text.

# ''(capsCase "What should I know about the holy Spirit's involvement in my life?")''

Titus 3

Titus was left in Crete to give leadership to the newly formed Churches and
Paul is writing to him.

''(digraph "GoodWorksFromGrace" ''

digraph {
  "God's grace" -> "Spiritual Riches" [label="produces"]
  "Spirit Riches" -> "Heart of Righteousness" [label="produces"]
  "Heart of Righteousness" -> "Good works" [label="produces"]
}

'')''

Titus 3:5. Good works are done in ourlives by the Holy Spirit's inner working
in our lives. See KJV version. Our salvation is by grace; not works.

washing
: speaks of water cleansing
: metaph. used of cleansing one's heart (see Eph 5:25)

Eph 5:25

sanctify
: to set apart

washing
: refers to ceremonial cleansing of OT priests. 
: For the Christian this means the daily cleansing of our hearts.

John 13:10

bathed
: perfect tense (he who has had a bath where the effects of that bath
continue).

He who has bathed need only to wash his feet. God provides a means by which 
we are cleansed daily. This talks about our confession of our sins, repentance
of our hearts and resubmitting to the authority of Christ over our lives.

Christ cleanses us of sin.

Reformation
: wiping your dirt off in grass
: doesn't completely wipe away the dirt

  HS -> Spirit [label="God combines with your spirit"]
}

'')''

Human Spirit (oxygen)
Holy Spirit (fuel)
God's Word (heat)

Mark 10:48;52

Jesus did this to show us that when we are dead to God we are blind. When the
Holy Spirit enters us we can then see and thus follow Christ.

God does an extreme make over in us - like HGTV.

# ''(capsCase "Embrace the renewing process")''


Titus 3:5
Romans 12:2

renewing
: greek root of metaphorphasis
: this is a process

Eph 4:22-24


The more we push aside the old nature the more Christ can enter in us to fill
the holes in our lives.

Georgia Muller - God had written Psalm 23 on his face.

2 Cor 3:18

Imagine you buy a house but it's moldy and dark. Overtime you renovate it. In
the same manner God does this. However, some people move in and not renovate
because it costs to much. It'll cost the lordship over their life and their
heart.

Titus 3:6

poured out
: aorist tense

made
: become
: ginomai

You will never be living at your fullest potential. There is always more and
more you can grow into in your walk with Christ.

# ''(capsCase "Recieve the full benefit of your justification")''

Titus 3:6-7

We have tons of benefits being in Christ

# Application

1. The HS presents you with a new nature that has far reaching implications.
Does that matter to you?

2. The Holy Spirit is the the key to unfolding all the riches of God has for
the believer to experience while livng here on this earth. Have you activiated
the divine riches God has for your life?
