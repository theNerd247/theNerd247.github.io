''# ''(label "title" "Is GO'ds Love On A Thermostat?")''

# Intro

Have you ever had anyone say to you "Hey, you are skating on thin ice!".

As adults we've all experienced the feeling that we're on thin ice. We
prefer to say it like:
  
  * My marriage is failing
  * my work situation is disintigrating
  * the bottom is falling out of my financial life

We all at times struggle with uncertainty.

However, God's love for us is certain. That truth is biblically portrayed in 
the Psalms:

> "God is my refuge and my fortress. He is a shelter for me"

God's love is like an aircraft carrier in our life. It gives us incomparable peace
and security in our lives. 

Proverbs 20:6

There are a lot of people who talk about their loyalty but rarely are there
those who will keep their commitment.

God's unchanging nature makes it impossible for Him to ever give us insecurity.

# What am I to Think about God's love during adversity?

${ref}:35

This chapter ends the first doctrinal section of the new testament.

"love of Christ"
: in this context it is synonymous to our salvation
: Or "What can separate us from our salvation?"

separate
: chorizo
: country, land, region, or a field
: "Can anyone put a country between us and God's salvation?"

tribulation
: speaks of pressure
: Offiliated when they want to punish someone by picking up a huge boulder and
  put it on the chest of the person.

distress
: "stenochoria"
: a tight squeeze
: 2 Cor 4:9

persecution
: diogmos
: the idea of one being chased

nakedness
: not nudity, but being so poor that they don't have the money to purchace
clothes to keep warm in winter.

peril
: kindynos
: in danger or at risk
: 2 Cor 11:26


Can any of the above separate us from God's salvation for us? ${ref}:37.
Absolutely not!!!

Jer 31:3

Paul re-assures us of God's love ${ref}:36 by referencing Psalm 44:22. He 
is saying that God's people should't be surprised that we will suffer.

# ''(capcase "Adversity can be a Sign of God's salvation not rejection")''

2 Tim 3:12

"In Christ Jesus"

1 Pe 4:12-14 

revelation 
: Christ's return during the millenium

# ''(capscase "God has made you a super conquerer")''

${ref}:37

"but" 
: Pay attention! Here's the great news!

conquerer
: nikao
: victory
: noun form is nike'

huper
: lit. "ontop of"

"more than conquers"
: hupernikao
: super conquers in Christ

loved
: in aorist tense (a point in time)
: This is pointing right back to the cross.

Christ's victory on the cross ensures our victory in life. When we have a trial
often we get and stay discouraged. 1 Cor 10:13. God will provide a way to
escape. 

Trials shouldn't be walking over us; we should be walking over our trials.

We get into a pull of gravity and we see ourselves as loosers. "I am a victor!
I don't have to give into this". 

"God I know this feeling isn't true. And I am holding onto your promises and I
trust that you will get me through this".

${ref}:38: these are theats in the spiritual world.

conviced
: perfect tense
: I have become at a point in time to remain strongly conviced.

2 Pe 1:3

knowledge
: experiencial knowledge
: The more I live by the word and experience His truth in my life I am conviced
that nothing can separate me.

Hymn: _It is well with my soul_: "Teach me to say it is well with my soul" was
changed to "Teach me to know it is well with my soul".

Knowledge is the instrument panel on that spiritual airplane that gets us
through the opaque clouds.

# ''(capscase "God wants you to live with confidence, not fear and anxiety.")''

${ref}:39

"In christ jesus our Lord"
: this is packed with theological implications.

''(dotgraph "inChrist" ''
digraph {
  Christian -> Christ [label="in"]
  Christ -> God [label="in"]
}

'')''

John 10:28

I give eternal life to them (believers).

never
: a double negative in the greek
: repetition is compounding.

perish
: subjunctive mood meaning they don't evean have the potential of parishing
: middle voice the subject acts on itself. They don't even have the potential
to perish in and of themselves.

Could it be any clear? We are in Christ and hidden in Christ.

What if I even set myself out of the reach of God?

# Application

1. adversity is a sign of salvation
1. I am a super conquerer - not a looser
1. God wants you to live with confidence - not fear and anxiety.

__REST IN GOD'S CONFIDENCE_

When we rest in who we are in Christ because He is our saftey net then we can
live a vibrant CHristian life.
