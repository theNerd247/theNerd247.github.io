''# ''(label "When You Experience Judgement and Criticism")''

# Intro

How do you feel when others oppose, criticise, or threaten you? Anger? Fear?
Rejected? Worthless?

Signifigant other x rejection (percieved / real) = anger and/or depression

depression = anger turned inward

What transpires in a person's psychy is amazing. People don't disagree and
simply move on.  There is a lot of pain that is left behind.

Remember that while this is the most encouraging passage in scripture we, as
Christians, will and do suffer.

Ronans 12:1-2 we need to have a biblical perspective in light of suffering.

Implicit in this passage is:

  * opposition
  * criticism
  * judgement

these are where our emotions are most vulnerable and affected.  How should I
respond to these?

${ref}:31 

"What then"
: contextual tieback
: in this case the context is ${ref}:29-30.

This is bottom line theology that should be topline priority.

* ${ref}:1
* ${ref}:35

${ref}:32

"did not withhold"
: Same language used when God was speaking of Abraham (Genesis 22:12)

Abraham loved God so much that He didn't withhold his only son. In the same manner,
so does God treat us - He loved us so much that He didn't

# When Opposition Arises Be Confident

In what? That He will take care of us.

${ref}:32 

"all things"
: What God has promised to us in Christ
: God providing for all our needs

_What are those needs?_ Only physical? If God took care of our greatest need
will he not provide everything else? If a husband gives the diamond ring will
he not also provide the box if asked?

Since we've received this wonderful gift and salvation

2 Peter 1:2-3

What if I sin? Will God not re-nig and remove His love for us? Doesn't He want us
to come back to Him and will provide a way to restore fellowship? 

"freely give"
: charis
: charizomai
: To be given a gift that is underserved.

${ref}:33

"elect"
: those who have trusted Christ

## God is The One Who Justifies

God is the one seated as a judge. When you are criticized it is not the person

_But isn't the criticism valid? Do we dismiss what is said? Maybe it is we
have to emotionally detach from the situation / not allow feelings of failure
creep up?_

Romans 4:2

"if"
: not case
: This shows that man is not saved by what He does

When we're dependent up on Christ we are perfect. Our flaws are covered and
not held against us. 

# When Your Enemies Judge You Be Fearless

God values you and accepts you. You have worth, value, and are wanted.

This is justificiation; the gift of worth without any merit.

_God I don't believe this. Help my unbelief_.

You don't have to fear what people think of you.

Thoe who are marinated in God's love do not sell out to win the love of others
(even God, because they know they have it).

These verses give no room for fear. Let us not get to heaven and be embarassed 
that we did not trust a fully trustworthy God.

_How do we handle the shame of not trusting God?_

${ref}:34

Who is the one who can keep on condemning you?

Micah 6:8 - be careful about listening to or speaking gossip for this condemns
others.

1 John 2:1, Heb 7:25

It's like a team golf game. The best score out of the team is the teams score.

# When Your Enemies Judge You Be Bold

Satan/others love to bring up the past. Many people cannot let go of the past,
even though they have put their lives back together.

Rev 12:10

_Who is our enemy?_

"Do you know what he did yesterday?! He calls himself a Christian but look at
what he does!? Can you believe it?". Christ replies, "Here is my blood, he has
been forgiven".

Zech 3:1-5; this is a picture of justification

"angel of the Lord"
: Pre-incarnate Christ

"filthy garments"
: a picture of sin

Now about those golf holes?

1. Resisting temptation when in your youth? Jesus hit a hole in one.
1. Pressure to conform but to say something for God's honor? Jesus hit a hole in one.
1. When you had righteous anger but kept silent? Jesus hit a hole in one.
1. When you should have kept your mouth shut and looked the fool? Jesus hit a hole in one.

Remember when playing team golf everyone gets a trophy. "Hey you didn't do so well! You don't deserve
that trophy!" - but the one who hit the perfect score says "My scorecard is his score card"

* be confident
* be fearless
* be bold.

# Application

* Remember God is pulling for you. Just like parents are for their kid when performing
* Nobody can nullify what God has done for you and says about you.
* Do not live in fear
*
