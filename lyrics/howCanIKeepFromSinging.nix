# How Can I Keep From Singing

''

''
There is an endless song

Echoes in my soul

I hear the music ring
''

''
And though the storms may come

I am holding on

To the rock I cling
''

{chorus = slides [

{chorusStart = slides [
''
How can I keep from singing Your praise

How can I ever say enough
''

''
How amazing is Your love

How can I keep from shouting Your name
''
];}

[ {chorusRepeatStart = 

''
I know I am loved by the King

And it makes my heart ''; }

{chorusRepeatEnd = ''want to sing''; }

]

];}

''
I will lift my eyes

In the darkest night

For I know my Savior lives
''

''
And I will walk with You

Knowing You'll see me through

And sing the songs You give
''

(r data.chorus)

''
I can sing in the troubled times

Sing when I win
''

''
I can sing when I lose my step

And fall down again
''

''
I can sing 'cause You pick me up

Sing 'cause You're there
''

''
I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord

When I call to You in prayer
''

''
I can sing with my last breath

Sing for I know
''

''
That I'll sing with the angels

And the saints around the throne
''
