"# Come to Jesus"

  newSlide 

  ''
Weak and wounded sinner, 

lost and left to die
''

newSlide
 ''
  Oh, raise your head, 

  for love is passing by
''

newSlide
 ''
  Come to Jesus, 

  come to Jesus, 

  come to Jesus and live
''

newSlide
 ''
  Now your burden's lifted 

  and carried far away
''

newSlide
 ''
  And precious blood 

  has washed away the stain
''

newSlide
 ''
  So, sing to Jesus, 
   
  sing to Jesus, 

  sing to Jesus and live
''

newSlide
 ''
  And like a newborn baby, 

  don't be afraid to crawl
''

newSlide
 ''
  And remember when you walk 

  sometimes we fall
''

newSlide
 ''
  So, fall on Jesus, 

  fall on Jesus,

  fall on Jesus and live
''

newSlide
 ''
  Sometimes the way is lonely 

  and steep and filled with pain

  ''

newSlide
 ''
  So, if your sky is dark 

  and pours the rain
''

newSlide
 ''
  Then, cry to Jesus, 

  cry to Jesus, 

  cry to Jesus and live
''

newSlide
 ''
  Oh, and when the love 

  spills over and 

  music fills the night

''

newSlide
 ''
  And when you can't contain 

  your joy inside

''
newSlide
 ''
  Then, dance for Jesus, 

  dance for Jesus, 

  dance for Jesus and live
''

newSlide
 ''
  And with your final heartbeat, 

  kiss the world goodbye

''

newSlide
 ''
  Then go in peace, and 

  laugh on Glory's side

''

newSlide
 ''
  And fly to Jesus, 

  fly to Jesus, 

  fly to Jesus and live
''

newSlide
 ''
  And fly to Jesus, 

  fly to Jesus, 

  fly to Jesus and live
''
