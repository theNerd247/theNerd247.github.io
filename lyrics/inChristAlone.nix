# In Christ Alone 
''

''
In Christ alone my hope is found

He is my light, my strength, my song
''

''
This cornerstone, this solid ground

Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
''

''
What heights of love, what depths of peace

When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
''

''
My comforter, my all in all

Here, in the love of Christ, I stand
''

''
In Christ alone, who took on flesh

Fullness of God in helpless babe
''

''
This gift of love and righteousness

Scorned by the ones he came to save
''

''
'Til on that cross, as Jesus died

The wrath of God was satisfied
''

''
For every sin, on him, was laid

Here, in the death of Christ, I live
''

''
There in the ground, his body lay

Light of the world, by darkness, slain
''

''
Then bursting forth in glorious day

Up from the grave, he rose again
''

''
And as he stands in victory

Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
''

''
For I am his and he is mine

Bought with the precious blood of Christ
''

''
No guilt in life, no fear in death

This is the power of Christ in me
''

''
From life's first cry to final breath

Jesus commands my destiny
''

  ''
  No power of hell, no scheme of man

  Could ever pluck me from his hand
  ''

  ''
  'Til he returns or calls me home

  Here, in the power of Christ, I stand
