''
How great the chasm 

that lay between us
''

newSlide

''
How high the mountain

I could not climb
''


newSlide

''
In desperation I turned to heaven
''


newSlide

''
And spoke Your name into the night
''

newSlide

''
Then through the darkness 

Your loving kindness
''

newSlide

''
Tore through the shadows of my soul
''


newSlide

''
The work is finished 

the end is written
''

newSlide

''
Jesus Christ my Living Hope
''


newSlide
''
Who could imagine so great a mercy
''
newSlide
''
What heart could fathom

such boundless grace
''

newSlide
''
The God of ages stepped 

down from glory
''
newSlide
''
To wear my sin and bear my shame
''
newSlide
''
The cross has spoken I am forgiven
''
newSlide
''
The King of Kings calls me His own
''
newSlide
''
Beautiful Savior I'm Yours forever
''
newSlide
''
Jesus Christ my Living Hope
''
newSlide
''
  Hallelujah praise the 

  one who set me free
''
newSlide
''
Hallelujah death has 

lost its grip on me
''
newSlide

''
You have broken every chain 

there's salvation in Your Name
''
newSlide

''
Jesus Christ my Living Hope
''

newSlide

''
Then came the morning 

that sealed the promise
''

newSlide
''
Your buried body

began to breathe
''
newSlide
''
Out of the silence the roaring Lion
''
newSlide
''
Declared the grave has no claim on me
''
newSlide
''
Then came the morning 

that sealed the promise
''
newSlide
''
Your buried body

began to breathe
''
newSlide

Out of the silence 

the roaring Lion
''
newSlide

Declared the grave has no claim on me
''
newSlide
''
Jesus Yours is the victory
''
newSlide

''
Hallelujah praise the 

one who set me free

Hallelujah death has 

lost its grip on me

You have broken every chain 

there's salvation in Your Name
