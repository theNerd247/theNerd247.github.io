[Verse 1]

A          
Stand-ing on the prom-is-es of Christ my King,
D                             A
Thro' e-ter-nal a-ges let His prais-es ring,
A    
Glo-ry in the highest I will shout and sing,
A               D      E     A
Standing on the promis-es of God.

[Chorus]

A          D          E                                    A      (D-A)
Stand-ing, stand-ing, Stand-ing on the promis-es of God my Savior,
A          D             A                E7            A         
Stand-ing, stand-ing…I’m stand-ing on the prom-is-es of God.

[Verse 2]

A       
Stand-ing on the prom-is-es that can-not fail,
D                                     A
When the howl-ing storms of doubt and fear as-sail,
A              
By the liv-ing Word of God I shall pre-vail,
A               D      E     A
Standing on the promis-es of God.

[Verse 3]

A                  
Stand-ing on the prom-is-es I now can see,
D                                   A
Per-fect, pres-ent cleansing in the blood for me,
A      
Standing in the lib-erty where Christ makes free,
A                D      E     A
Stand-ing on the promis-es of God.

[Verse 4]

A   
Stand-ing on the prom-is-es of Christ the Lord,
D                            A
Bound to Him e-ter-nal-ly by love’s strong cord,
A
O-ver-com-ing dai-ly with the Spir-it’s sword,
A                D      E     A
Stand-ing on the promis-es of God.
