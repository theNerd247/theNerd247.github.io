"# It Is Well With My Soul"

newSlide

''
When peace like a river 

Attendeth my way,
''

newSlide

''
When sorrows like sea billows roll,
''

newSlide

''
Whatever my lot, 

Thou hast taught me to say,
''

newSlide

''
"It is well, 

It is well with my soul."
''

newSlide

''
Though Satan should buffet, 

Though trials should come
''

newSlide

''
Let this blest assurance control
''

newSlide

''
That Christ has regarded 

My helpless estate
''

newSlide

''
And has shed His own blood for my soul
''

{ chorus = [
''
It is well

(It is well)
''

newSlide

''
With my soul,

(With my soul)
''

newSlide

''
It is well, 

It is well with my soul.
''

newSlide

''
My sin - O, the bliss 

Of this glorious thought
''

newSlide

''
My sin - not in part but the whole
''

newSlide

''
Is nailed to the cross 

And I bear it no more
''

newSlide

''
Praise the Lord, 

Praise the Lord, O my soul
''

newSlide

''
And, Lord haste the day 

When the faith shall be sight
''

newSlide

''
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
''

newSlide

''
The trump shall resound 

And the Lord shall descend
''

newSlide

''
Even so - it is well with my soul
''
