Put humans in your sentances and use active verbs. This keeps you from sounding
air headed.

For example:

> One may play the piano from time to time whence bordome becomes them.
makes me sound like a butler who's holding his nose shut. But:

> People play the piano when their bored.
is short, simple, and human.
