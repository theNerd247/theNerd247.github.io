A.W Tozer used to prostrate Himself on the floor pleading with God to reveal
knowledge concerning His Word to him. I used to think "self-taught" meant
"really smart". Now I'm realizing it just means "desperate and without a human
guide". We should ask God to help us understand. And not just His word - but
everything we want to understand: math, science, art, medicine, music, driving,
finances, relationships. When we are only self taught we are proud. When we are
self taught and crying out we are teachable.
