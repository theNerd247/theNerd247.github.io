# The Lords Compassion

Joel 2:13 

> "... And rend your heart and not your garments"
> Now return to the LORD your God. 
> _For He is gracious and compassionate.
> Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness_
> And relenting of evil

Joel 2:25

> Then I will make up to you for the years 
> That the swarming locust has eaten.
> The creeping locust, the stripping locust and the gnawing locust,
> My great army which I sent among you.
> You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied.
> And praise the name of the LORD your God
> Who has dealt wondrously with you;
> Then My people will never be put to shame. 

Psalm 103:2-5

> Who pardons all your iniquities
> Who heals all your diseases
> Who redeems your life from the pit
> Who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion
> Who satisfies your years with good things. 
> So that your youth is renewed like the eagle.

Psalm 103:8-14

> The LORD is compassionate and gracious,
> Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness
> He will not always strive with us.
> Nor will He keep His anger forever.
> He has not dealt with us according to our sins.
> Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities
> For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
> So great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear Him.
> As far as the east is from the west,
> So far has He removed our transgressions from us.
> Just as a father has compassion on his children,
> So the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.
> For He Himself knows our frame;
> He is mindful that we are but dust.

Psalm 56:8

> You have taken account of my wanderings;
> Put my tears in Your bottle.
> Are they not in Your book?

The LORD does not take pleasure in bringing pain in our life. His heart is
broken - He weeps - because of the sin I commit and because of the sins
committed against me. He is not emotionless in His discipline - He records all
my tears. But His anger can be kindled. Repeated defiance will make Him scourge
us. But it is a scourging that we can bear up against - not one to destroy us
but to bring us back into fellowship with Him.

When I am are under His discipline I cry out. And when I pause I wonder if He
thinks "Quit whining! You humans are such babies. Always worrying and never
trusting. Suck it and take it like a man! I'm not hurting you". But Psalm
103:14 paints a different picture. He knows that when He disciplines us we will
hurt. And He wants us to cry out to Him. Telling God you're in pain when you're
disciplined is a very appropriate response.

Remember the LORD is compassionate - He knows your pain - and quick to forgive.
