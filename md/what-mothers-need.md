# Intro

Survey about what mother's needed most:

  - confirmation I'm doing the right thing
  - a sanity check
  - encouragement
  - support
  - time off
  - adult conversation
  - time with GOd
  - a dishwasher that loads itself
  - someone who understands how I feel
  - To feel that what I do is important

There are 7 needs of a mother

# Mother's Need A commitment to the Lord and His Word  

2 Tim 1:5

Sincere faith
: non-hypocritical
: a genuine faith

Because of Timothy's background he develop a genuine faith. When Paul told
Timothy to transfer the knowledge of His faith just as it was transfered from
his mother.

After someone is trained by his mentor they will become like them. Faith is
contagious 1 Thes 1:5-6. An authentic life is contagious - truth is more often
caught than taught. We desire to give out students the best teachers we can
find.  Why not be the best model for Christ for them?

See Susana Wesley

> Let France have great mothers and France will have great Sons

Exposure to God's word doesn't make you mature. It's not just the knowledge of
God's word but a commitment to have it breathed through you.

# A Mother Needs Wisdom to Impart God's Truth

Proverbs 8, 31:1

King Lemuel (probably Solomon - a name given by Bethsheba to her son). This is 
an example of a mother passing wisdom down to her son.

What is wisdom? The ability to apply the principles of God's word to real life
circumstances and to do it with balance. To know is not to be wise. To know how
to use knowledge is wisdom. Knowing what to say and how to say it. And when to 
not speak.

# Mother's Need A Heart Felt Forgiveness

Mark 11:25

Many mother's need to forgive themselves. Many feel guilty. They have this
notion that they have to live perfectly and they are afraid that they will pass
on their imperfections to their children.

You are not called to be perfect. Romans 8:1.

Remember Adam and Eve - one son was evil, the other good. Remember that the
greatest parent the world has ever known has wayward children - God.

This is why Christ died. 

# Courage to One Day Let Go of Your Children

Genesis 2:24

> They shall become one flesh.

There is a time when your children should leave you and you let them go. When
you raise your children to never let go you build into them a co-dependency
that will be deadly when they get older.

Remember your children need to know who's children they really are: God's.

# Mother's Need to Know Your Biblical Identity

Ephesians 1

Why is this imporant for mothers? Because who they are is in Christ. They
wrapped their identity up in their children.

# Mother's Need A Husband That are Encouragers

1 Samuel 1:8

Husband of Hannah was trying to encourage her. 

Husbands 

  - leave notes from time to time.
  - be an active participant in the rearing of the children
Ephesans 6:4 - father's bring your children up in the discipline and
instruction of the Lord. There are many fathers that let their wives do all the
work and act as a cheerleader from a distance. Father's need to take the lead.

# Mother's Need Husbands Who are Spiritual Leaders

Ephesians 5:23

The husband is the head of the wife just also as Christ is the head of the
Church. 

Today many men have a loser's limp - the purpose of the limp is to camoflage 
their failure. 

Real men do not use their past as an excuse for their behavior - but identify
what needs to change in their lives.
