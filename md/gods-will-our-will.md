# God's Will

* What do we mean when we say:

  * God's will for me
  * God's sovereignty
  * God's plan for my life.
  * God allowed it to happen

# My Will

* What do we mean when we say:

  * My will
  * I have freewill
  * I was destined

# Abide

Present thoughts:

Some circumstances God commands and doesn't command.

Command:
  
  * General (space, time, people, etc.)
    
    * Commands that are from Scripture. These are written down and intended to be obeyed.
  * Peoples specific
    
    * Commands given for a specific group of people - typically Israel. These
      are mostly written down in Scripture.
  * Personal

    * These are unique to each person and intended to be obeyed only by the
      person receiving the command. They will never contradict the General or
      Peoples commands. Often given through the "still small voice" of God in
      quiet times. These are more rare than the other forms of commands.

Not Command

  * Creativity / Ownership
    
    * God gives us room to be creative. He doesn't give a command because the
      matter doesn't require one. If a command were given it would be "be
      creative".

    * Direct commands may not be given because God wants us to be responsible for
      the circumstance at hand. Freedom is given in making decisions and we
      shouldn't feel guilty if we did not sin. If a command were give it would be
      "be responsible".
    
  * Lack of Control

    * Somethings are out of our control and therefore we cannot be commanded
      one way or another. God is using the circumstances to sanctify us. If a
      command were given it would be "wait" or "listen" or "be patient".
