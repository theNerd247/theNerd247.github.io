I'm think about how I would design a program for generating documentation from
a given AST. My initial thoughts are:

  * Maintain doc strings from source code as comments
  * Data declaration syntax. I.e:
    
    ```
    data Foo 
      -- | Bar documentation here
      = Bar 
      -- | Blarg documentation here
      | Blarg

    type Bob = 
      -- | Marley documentation here
      { marley :: Num 
      -- | Jack documentation here
      , jack   :: String 
      }
    ```
  * Link other pieces of the document together:

      * links the user declares
      * links generated by keywords created by declarations in the language
  * Support multiple files - modules etc.?
  * write the program as a fold over the AST
