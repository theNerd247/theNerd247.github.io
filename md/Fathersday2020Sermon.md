# Intro

We never get over our father's. They have a huge impact in our lives.

What are the Biblical guidelines

# Best things a Father Can do For His Kids

Eph 5:23 - 32

## Love his wife.

By giving things to our children it'll make them feel loved and secure -
FALSE!!! It is for a father is to love his wife. The marriage is the focus
of the home. The proof is found in the order of the text.

The husband sets the temperature of the home; the wife the thermostat. If she 
feels loved and secure from the husband then she will love her children deeply.

1. Date your wife often
1. Keep the romance in your marriage
1. Set goals in your marriage each year.
1. Make prayer for your family top priority

## A Father Who Obeys The Father

Children learn what is right and wrong based on how the father acts. They learn
obedience as they see their father obey.

Be sold out for Christ in your life. 1 Cor 11:13, 1 Thes 1:6-8, 2:14.

## A Father Who Respects Authority

Eph 5:2

Difference between obey and honor? It is one of attitude. We can throw the
people we work with under the bus at the dinner table. Children learn that it's
ok to have a bad attitude as long as they go through the motions of obedience.

1 Peter 2:14

# Best Things a Father Can Do To His Kids

Eph 5:4

## Respect His Kids

You treat your children with dignity. This doesn't mean that you allow them to
rule the house and do whatever they want. 

We so dote over our children that they become the center of the universe.

_What are some ways we don't respect our children?_

Dad's don't let mom take over your responsibility.

should discipline our children. 

Proverbs 13:24 - discipline and love are not mutually exclusive.

## Father's Are To Guide Them

Eph 5:4

Bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. 

instruction has the idea of confronting. Psalm 127:3-4
