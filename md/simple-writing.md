Research papers are difficult to read. And I'm learning that it's not because I
am unintelligent or ignorant. It's that the author is a poor editor.

Here are a few tips for writing well[^1]:

  * write in a manner that's easy to read aloud.
  * place verbs as close to nouns as possible
  * avoid paranthetical text in sentences [1].
  * don't mangle ideas together. Sentences,  paragraphs, etc should have a
    single idea
  * build up and then make a point; don't make your point and then hurry to 
    give its proof aftarwards. 
  * make conclusions of sentences match subjects of following sentences [2].
  * state the obvious; but not "too obvious". - someone will thank you later.
  * avoid technical words that only your colleges would know (jargon).
