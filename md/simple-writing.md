Research papers are difficult to read. And I'm learning that it's not because I
don't have enough background in the subject material. It's that the author is a
poor editor.

Here are a few tips for writing well:

  * write in the way you speak
  * place verbs as close to the nouns as possible
  * avoid paranthetical text in sentences. For example:

    > You may - for very necessary purposes in avoiding obfuscated languages
    > - want to not write like this.

    A few alternatives for side notes:

      * don't include them
      * use foot/margin notes
      * Add another, separate sentence or paragraph[^1] before or after the
        sentence. 


[^1]: Often I find that parenthetical statements are evidence that more thought
  needs to go into your prose. Either the reader needs background information
  or you want to dive deeper into a topic. Think of parenthetical notes as your
  child interrupting you while you're talking.
