title: Hierarchy of Lambda Calculus Terms
tags:
  - lambda-calculus
  - types

I've heard many keywords while researching type theory and lambda calculus over
the years. Here's a few and their relationships[^1]:

```
Unyped
  ↓ (adds concrete types)
Simply Typed
  ↓ (adds polymorphic types)
System F
  ↓ (adds
System F-ω
Hindley Milner 
Martin-Löf Type Theory
```

[^1]: I'll omit "lambda calculus" from the keywords indicated because it would
  be extranious. Assume most words end with "lambda calculus". Exceptions are
  "Martin-Löf"
