# Shame at His Coming

I feel this way sometimes. There are moments where I pause to analyze my
relationship with God and feel ashamed. I keep struggling with sexual sin. I
don't want to spend time in His word. I'm almost 30 and I'm not "doing a lot"
for God. And worst of all: I'm unsure of my whole life. What my career will be,
where my home will be, who will be my wife. Am I handling my money correctly?
On and on it goes.

A couple years ago I was afraid that I would show up on heavens doorstep and
God would be shaking his head. "That is not what I had planned for you, Noah.
You completely missed the life I had for you". To be clear, I felt I missed the
life God had planned for me because I was to stupid and anxious about my life;
not because I was gallivanting out of disobedience. I was trying so hard to
figure out what God had called me to do and never feeling like I had a clear
solution. 

For example, I had huge questions about my career: "What if my software
engineering career is not where God wants me? What if I'm doing this because I
used it as an escape hatch when I was a kid? What if I was made to do something
else but because of my addictions I've put myself here? Am I really doing what
God created me to do?" I was ashamed He would be disappointed in me. That I was
supposed to be a pastor or a missionary. I wanted to be able to look back on my
life and list all the things I did for God.

Equally, I wanted to look at my character and see I was less sinful than I was.
And this was a huge blow. I have been a sex addict for as long as I can
remember[^1]. When I look at my character I am ashamed. I want to have
something to measure my character and my heart against so that I can confirm
I'm safe, that I'm OK; doing good and not "that" bad. I want to be the judge of
my own character.  To say "I struggle with these areas of my life but at least
it's not as bad as it used to be. At least I don't look at porn anymore."

Right now I do not have confidence. And He hasn't even returned and I shrink
away. I don't want to think of God during the day because I know I am still
struggling with sexual sin. My mind is filled with thoughts of making out with
Lauren or having sex with someone[^1].
