Let's recreate lambda calculus in python. 

Here's a challenge: write all of your python code using only the simplest language construct you can think of: the function. Oh, and you can only use lambdas (see <2016406>) because you could cheat in writing recursive functions if you had traditional functions. Ready? Here we go! 

First let's try and do something simple: the identity function. It's so simple it doesn't do anything - just spits back whatever comes in:

```
lambda (x): x
```
And using it:

```
(lambda (x): x)(2)
⇒ 2
```
We're passing in `2` (1) to the identity lambda which will evaluate to `2`...boring.

Let's do something more sophisticated: the const function.

```
(lambda (first): lambda (second): first)(2)(3)
⇒ (lambda (second): 2) (3)
⇒ 2
```

1. Ok, technially we're cheating; `2` is something other than a lambda. To keep things understandable I'll cheat by using some very basic primitives (only numbers, booleans, and their respective operators). But you should know we could very well get rid of them and encode them using only lambdas.
