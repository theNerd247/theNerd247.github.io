Let's recreate lambda calculus in python. 

Here's a challenge: write all of your python code using only the simplest language construct you can think of: the function. Oh, and you can only use lambdas (see <2016406>) because you could cheat in writing recursive functions if you had traditional functions. Ready? Here we go! 

First let's try and do something simple: the identity function. It's so simple it doesn't do anything - just spits back whatever comes in:

```
lambda (x): x
```
And using it:

```
(lambda (x): x)(2)
⇒ 2
```
We're passing in `2` (1) to the identity lambda which will evaluate to `2`. You could think of the lambda function as a vending machine (<2016408>).

Let's do something more sophisticated: the const function.

```
(lambda (x): lambda (y): first)(2)(3)
⇒ (lambda (y): 2) (3)
⇒ 2 
```
Here the outer lambda returns not a value but another lambda! The outer lambda is like a vending machine that spits out another machine when a value is inserted:

![lambda const machine](./static/lambdaMachineConst.jpeg)
The inner machine (labelled "Inner λ") will then spit out `2` when a value is put into it. This is why it's called const. The outer lambda generates another lambda that ignores its input and returns the same value no matter what.

```
┌─(outer lambda)────────────┐
│                           │
│            ┌(inner)──────┐│
│            │             ││
(lambda (x): (lambda (y): x))
         │                ↑
         └────────────────┘
   x in the inner lambda refers to 
   the input of the outer lambda
```

Thinking of nested lambdas as nested vending machines can only go so far before it gets confusing. So here's an easier way to think about nested lambdas: their functions with multiple inputs.

<!-- 
note it may be better to introduce nested lambdas as a way to add multiple numbers instead. Const has a lot of moving pieces for a beginner

1. Ok, technially we're cheating; `2` is something other than a lambda. To keep things understandable I'll cheat by using some very basic primitives (only numbers, booleans, and their respective operators). But you should know we could very well get rid of them and encode them using only lambdas.
