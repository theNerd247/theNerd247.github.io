<p>A DSL is a very specific language that aims to make encoding solutions to a certain problem domain more intuitive.</p>
<p>A person programs when they take any solution and “write it down”. For example a cook programs a cake by writing the recipe down. Recipes are programs and executing a recipe is the making of the cake.</p>
<p>If encoding made is easy then creating solutions becomes easier. Not because the problem is any easier to solve; but trying out new solutions takes little brain power and time.</p>
<p>EAQL is a domain specific language for threat research and analysis. It was designed to allow network security analysts to “write down their thoughts” and automate executing them. For example:</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<p>Functional programming provides a universal backbone - a machine that generates other langauges - for encoding human logic into a computer. It makes it easy to combine create solutions and combine them in an easy way.</p>
