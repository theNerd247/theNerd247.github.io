# ''{ title = "Worship Like The Wise Men"; }''

# Intro

Emily Post - the guru on social edicate. Today she would be appalled at
the lack of manners. For example no one brings a gift when going to a
dinner party. Thankfully we still bring gifts to birthday parties.

So what about Christmas? What gift do we give to the king of kings?

## Context

Matthew 2 


  - "they came from the east"

from the east
: from the rising of the sun 

magi
: has root in persian language
: not a common word 
: used as a designation for leaders/kings as being particular people
: transliterated as magician, magnificant, and magnum. Each meaning "great".

They were from the descendents of Shem. Practiced Zoroastrianism - a pre
Islamic religion. Their god was monotheistic (called Mazda). How in the 
world would they have interest in the Messiah?

Remember Daniel and the Jews were taken into captivity by Babylon. The vision
of the 4 kingdoms was given him where in the Medes and Persians would take
over Babylon. Thus the Medes and Persians heard this teaching from the Jews.
There were others - not just the Jews - that were looking for a Messiah.

Spiritually these men worshiped Christ. They were pagan - however it is
probable that they had some belief in Christ. The Magi used a star - which
the magi loved to study - to draw them to the babe Christ. 

The star was possibly God's shikinah glory; leading like the pillar of fire.

They travelled a very far distance on camels. And brought extreme riches.

Isaiah 60:4-7 (a partial picture of what was to come prior to the first coming of Christ).

# Sacrifice As The First Gift

Do we sacrifice for Christ? 

> In love for my savior I am going to sacrifice for Christ. Whatever it means
to give > up what is comfortable for me so that I am serving Him.

This means that it's incumbent on us to say "God I'm yours". Do we really mean
this? As you think about gifts don't forget about your sacrifice for Christ.

> What can I get a King? I guess I can give Him myself.

This means that you are ready to identify with Christ and say: "I am in Christ
and Christ in me". 

Micah 5:2. Intellectually speaking we are Christians because of the
overwhelming veracity of Scripture. 

I am not going to identify myself as an American or anything. I stand with Him!
I will be counted as a Christian with Him in this world. Like a submarine we
are not meant to live under deep water. There is immense pressure from the
outside to conform to the rest of the world. But we have the H.S in us!

Matthew 2:8

Herod probably knew of the verse in Micah 5 however he was skeptical. So he
sent the magi.

# Sacrifice Popularity For Solidarity

We live in a world were people are consumed  with wanting to be accepted.
Many are trying to make Christianity acceptable. Today people say "we will
not tolerate your Biblical ethics and standards". 

Today we make abortion acceptable. Psalm 139 says so. 

Be loving and graceful when with people but stand firm for the truth.

# Sacrifice Idols for Real Treasures

worship
: to ascribe glory to the LORD and credit to His name
: "kabod" 
: gravitas, the importance, dignity. 
: It is saying to the LORD "Your are the most important person in my life".

We need to progressively be giving over different areas of our lives.

idol 
: something I will not give up to God

In light of eternity this is just a short window.

# Application

> Isaac Wats:
> When I survey the wondrous cross 
> On which the prince of glory died
> My richeest gain I count but loss
> And pour contempt on all my pride
> 
> Were the whole realm of nature mine
