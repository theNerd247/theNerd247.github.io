<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Many people are searching for purpose in life all the while they are missing what is right in front of them - the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Imagine that God has given you a house while you are living outside. You wouldn’t turn this down would you? God is saying “Instead of looking for peace from the world (cars, money, houses, spouses, tv, internet, pornography, etc.) run to me! I have given you my Spirit! You simply need to activate me”.</p>

<p>He who has bathed need only to wash his feet. God provides a means by which we are cleansed daily. This talks about our confession of our sins, repentance of our hearts and resubmitting to the authority of Christ over our lives.</p>
<p>Christ cleanses us of sin.</p>

<p>Mark 10:48;52</p>
<p>Jesus did this to show us that when we are dead to God we are blind. When the Holy Spirit enters us we can then see and thus follow Christ.</p>
<p>God does an extreme make over in us - like HGTV.</p>

<p>2 Cor 3:18</p>
<p>Imagine you buy a house but it’s moldy and dark. Overtime you renovate it. In the same manner God does this. However, some people move in and not renovate because it costs to much. It’ll cost the lordship over their life and their heart.</p>
