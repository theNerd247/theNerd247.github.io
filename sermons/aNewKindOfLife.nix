# Intro

We have resident in each of us God's heart, we have all the resources
we need and yet believers live as if they are living on empty.

Have you lost hope that your life (Christian) is not what it is what
you want it to be? Do you struggle with the same sin or worthless feeling
with no avail? 

Yes they may believe God will help them but what does that really mean? 
We believe 

> "God helps those who help themselves"

There are little difference between the habits of the believer and the secular
man. Guilt is usually the main motivator for obedience and thus is usually
short lived. One of the great dangers of the Christian life is that we grow
complacent and we lose the passion for Jesus! Our greatest fear is that we become
a wicked old man - calloused and unpleasant.

## We are Commanded To Be Filled

''(r data.ref)'':14
: quote out of OT 

death
: separated from God
: Practically - a ho-hum complacent Christian life

''(r data.ref)'':15-16 be:

  * wise
  * redeem the time
"Therefore [to do the above] do not be foolish _but_ understand what the will
of the LORD is."

''(r data.ref)'':18 This is a command! Each believer is to be filled with the
Spirit.  He's not saying "This would be a great idea if you would just let the
HS control you".

_God is not into suggestions but commands_.

There is no command to be baptized, sealed, or indwelled by the HS. 

filled
: present tense (keep on being filled)
: in plural (Y'all be filled) it is meant for all Christians
: Grk: "pleroo"
: power or control that is to be had. Often spoken of the wind filling the
  sails of a ship.
: lit. filling a cup
: see John 16:6, Luke 4:28, Acts 13:45

## It is meant for all believers

You cannot see the HS but you can see the effects of the HS. He is like
electricity - He is always there, but you have to tap into Him. Without
the Spirit controlling us life can become a hassle. 

How often do we look at other believers and say "What a spiritual giant!"
why can't I be like that? When the HS fills a particular believer He manifests
His works in a way that is tied closely with that person's natural gifts
and personality/temperament.

''(digraph "In Christ" ''

Hell -> cross [label="salvation"]
Cross -> "In Christ" [label="Position"]
Cross -> "Filling of HS" [label="Fellowship"]

"Filling of HS" -> "OOF" [label="sin"]
"OOF" -> "Filling of HS" -> [label="confession"]

'')''

Ministries of HS:

  * Indwelt
  * Sealed
  * baptized
One can resist the filling ministry of the HS, but you cannot do the filling
yourself. When we allow the HS to control us we can do things we never
would have imagined.

You cannot fill something that is already filled. If you already are filling
your life with things that soothe your deep longing the HS cannot fill within
you. Sadly Christians too often are trying to fill their life with things
that bring no long term solution.

Because of the present tense.

## This is a continuous experience

The filling of the HS. Life depletes that ministry in our lives.

Even though it is a continuous action, do not believe that because you are not
being filled then He leaves you. "If I've done such and such horrible thing
then He would leave me". You __must DAILY activate the filling of the HS__.

## It Is A Matter of Control

This isn't just an indwelling, but a controlling. A drunk person is controlled
by alcohol, a HS filled person is controlled by the HS. 

drunk
: riotousness or rowdiness such that almost a different person is exhibited.

The man who is filled acts in ways that are unnatural to Him. _The controlling 
of the HS removes all excuses in one's life_. 

  * my personality - don't blame your sin nature on God.
  * this is how I was raised - God can change you
  * I've always been this way - you have not known fully what it is to be guided fully.

God plants His heart into our lives. Instead of spending our time and energy to
change ourselves we should spend our times learning how to be filled. A drunk need only to
take a drink to be drunk


## How do I activate the Spirit's filling?

* Be totally dependent upon God: embrace the essential element of total
dependence. John 15: apart from me you can do Nothing.

The spirit filled life begins when we are absolutely convinced we can do
nothing apart from the HS.  When we reveal we are completely hopeless! Without
meaning to Christians live without God's spirit in their daily lives. When they
fail they get back up and say "I'll try harder next time".

What is surrender? 

''(digraph "Surrender" ''

Sex -> Throne
Business -> Throne
Relationships -> Throne
Financial -> Throne
Family -> Throne

Throne -> HS [label="Filled"]
Throne -> Self [label="OOF"]

'')''

Isaiah 53:6. Because we have this old nature we are all rebels at heart.

The problem with a living sacrifice is that it keeps crawling off the alter.

The start of filling is often brokenness.

The danger is that there is some formula for filling - but the reality is that
the filling comes when we live a day-by-day surrendered life.
