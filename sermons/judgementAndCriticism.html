<h1 id="when-you-experience-judgement-and-criticism">When You Experience Judgement and Criticism</h1>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>How do you feel when others oppose, criticise, or threaten you? Anger? Fear? Rejected? Worthless?</p>
<p>Signifigant other x rejection (percieved / real) = anger and/or depression</p>
<p>depression = anger turned inward</p>
<p>What transpires in a person’s psychy is amazing. People don’t disagree and simply move on. There is a lot of pain that is left behind.</p>
<p>Remember that while this is the most encouraging passage in scripture we, as Christians, will and do suffer.</p>
<p>Ronans 12:1-2 we need to have a biblical perspective in light of suffering.</p>
<p>Implicit in this passage is:</p>
<ul>
<li>opposition</li>
<li>criticism</li>
<li>judgement</li>
</ul>
<p>these are where our emotions are most vulnerable and affected. How should I respond to these?</p>
<p>Romans 8:31</p>
<dl>
<dt>“What then”</dt>
<dd>contextual tieback
</dd>
<dd>in this case the context is Romans 8:29-30.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is bottom line theology that should be topline priority.</p>
<ul>
<li>Romans 8:1</li>
<li>Romans 8:35</li>
</ul>
<p>Romans 8:32</p>
<dl>
<dt>“did not withhold”</dt>
<dd>Same language used when God was speaking of Abraham (Genesis 22:12)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Abraham loved God so much that He didn’t withhold his only son. In the same manner, so does God treat us - He loved us so much that He didn’t</p>
<h1 id="when-opposition-arises-be-confident">When Opposition Arises Be Confident</h1>
<p>In what? That He will take care of us.</p>
<p>Romans 8:32</p>
<dl>
<dt>“all things”</dt>
<dd>What God has promised to us in Christ
</dd>
<dd>God providing for all our needs
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>What are those needs?</em> Only physical? If God took care of our greatest need will he not provide everything else? If a husband gives the diamond ring will he not also provide the box if asked?</p>
<p>Since we’ve received this wonderful gift and salvation</p>
<p>2 Peter 1:2-3</p>
<p>What if I sin? Will God not re-nig and remove His love for us? Doesn’t He want us to come back to Him and will provide a way to restore fellowship?</p>
<dl>
<dt>“freely give”</dt>
<dd>charis
</dd>
<dd>charizomai
</dd>
<dd>To be given a gift that is underserved.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Romans 8:33</p>
<dl>
<dt>“elect”</dt>
<dd>those who have trusted Christ
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="god-is-the-one-who-justifies">God is The One Who Justifies</h2>
<p>God is the one seated as a judge. When you are criticized it is not the person</p>
<p><em>But isn’t the criticism valid? Do we dismiss what is said? Maybe it is we have to emotionally detach from the situation / not allow feelings of failure creep up?</em></p>
<p>Romans 4:2</p>
<dl>
<dt>“if”</dt>
<dd>not case
</dd>
<dd>This shows that man is not saved by what He does
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When we’re dependent up on Christ we are perfect. Our flaws are covered and not held against us.</p>
<h1 id="when-your-enemies-judge-you-be-fearless">When Your Enemies Judge You Be Fearless</h1>
<p>God values you and accepts you. You have worth, value, and are wanted.</p>
<p>This is justificiation; the gift of worth without any merit.</p>
<p><em>God I don’t believe this. Help my unbelief</em>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to fear what people think of you.</p>
<p>Thoe who are marinated in God’s love do not sell out to win the love of others (even God, because they know they have it).</p>
<p>These verses give no room for fear. Let us not get to heaven and be embarassed that we did not trust a fully trustworthy God.</p>
<p><em>How do we handle the shame of not trusting God?</em></p>
<p>Romans 8:34</p>
<p>Who is the one who can keep on condemning you?</p>
<p>Micah 6:8 - be careful about listening to or speaking gossip for this condemns others.</p>
<p>1 John 2:1, Heb 7:25</p>
<p>It’s like a team golf game. The best score out of the team is the teams score.</p>
<h1 id="when-your-enemies-judge-you-be-bold">When Your Enemies Judge You Be Bold</h1>
<p>Satan/others love to bring up the past. Many people cannot let go of the past, even though they have put their lives back together.</p>
<p>Rev 12:10</p>
<p><em>Who is our enemy?</em></p>
<p>“Do you know what he did yesterday?! He calls himself a Christian but look at what he does!? Can you believe it?”. Christ replies, “Here is my blood, he has been forgiven”.</p>
<p>Zech 3:1-5; this is a picture of justification</p>
<dl>
<dt>“angel of the Lord”</dt>
<dd>Pre-incarnate Christ
</dd>
<dt>“filthy garments”</dt>
<dd>a picture of sin
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now about those golf holes?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Resisting temptation when in your youth? Jesus hit a hole in one.</li>
<li>Pressure to conform but to say something for God’s honor? Jesus hit a hole in one.</li>
<li>When you had righteous anger but kept silent? Jesus hit a hole in one.</li>
<li>When you should have kept your mouth shut and looked the fool? Jesus hit a hole in one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember when playing team golf everyone gets a trophy. “Hey you didn’t do so well! You don’t deserve that trophy!” - but the one who hit the perfect score says “My scorecard is his score card”</p>
<ul>
<li>be confident</li>
<li>be fearless</li>
<li>be bold.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="application">Application</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remember God is pulling for you. Just like parents are for their kid when performing</li>
<li>Nobody can nullify what God has done for you and says about you.</li>
<li>Do not live in fear</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
