# ''{title = "Praying Through The Pain"; }''

# Intro

Christians are heading down the highway at 70 miles an hour in life and know
there's something that needs tending but don't stop to address it.

God uses pain to get our attention to address what He wants to change us.

How can my pain connect me better with God? How can I go to God in prayer to
connect with His peace in my life?

${ref}:14-17

1. Leading
2. Assuring us of our relationship
3. Acting as our assurance of our glorification

Like sonar we need something to prevent us from running into walls.

${ref}:26-27

Before we come to Christ we are upside down; salvation rights us. But our world
is still upsidedown; thus collateral damage and difficulty remains in our
lives. Sin still resides in us.

${ref}:18 we still go through hardships and suffering. However, the assumption
is that we pray.

_How can my pain connect me better with God?_

# Let The Pain Summon You To More Prayer

Have a mindset that you are going to take it to the Lord in prayer.

Increase your quiet time! Make more time for prayer.

Often we just vent to others. Christian, take it to the Lord in prayer first!
If your first thought is to fix it, push your next to be to take it to the Lord
in prayer. This is a vital resource in the Christian life.

Ps 23 - We say "God I don't want to walk through the valley of death how about
taking me another way?" No, David realises that he must go through the valley.
God doesn't always calm the storm - nevertheless he will bring some kind of
deliverance to those who call upon God.

Ps 34:15-22

Emotionally hard times will hit - we rush to fix the problem or turn to someone
to talk to.

Can you drop to your knees and cry out to God: "I give up...what do you want me
to do?" Can you run to God in prayer? _Don't leave that privilege on the
table_.

> Oh what peace we often forfeit 
> Oh what needless pain we bear. 
> All because we do not carry 
>   everything to God in prayer.

Spend extra time with your heavenly father.

Like in war - the radio man is the biggest target; it prevents us from
communicating for reinforcements.

# Recognize Your Weakness 

${ref}:26

State the problem to God - not the solution.

> we do not know what to pray
> NJKV

Greek NT says:

> We do not konw "the what" to pray for. 

Thus there is something specific.

> We do not know what to pray for as it is necessary.

We need to know what to pray for specifically. We pray because we are hurthing.
"God I have this pain and I want you to remove that pain".  But we miss out on
the important lesson we are being taught in our lives.

We shape our prayer requests more based on how we feel than God's will.

Why recognize our weakness? in ${ref}:26 Paul is asking us to go to God and ask
Him to show us his will.

Did Paul not know God's will? 

2 Cor. 12 

${ref}:26b The Spirit intercedes on behalf of the believer.

Imagine seeing a man in trouble with the cops as you drive by. Knowing him you
stop and defend him; getting him out of trouble.

## Mis-Interpretations of ${ref}:26

* As an argument for the gift of tongues
* A profound judgement such that it's inexpressable. They use 2 Cor 9:15, 12:4,
  1 Pe 1:8 to argue for this.
* The spirit taking us to higher and holier thoughts to the point the only expression
  is groanings and sighings.

inexpressable
: wordless

Other places of intercession 

  * 1 John 2:1
  * John 17?

The defence attorney intercedes for you by telling you what to say before the
judge.

Phil 2:12b here is a reference of how God directs us.

The Spirit's intercession is God revealing his will to us.

Like a child sitting in the parent's lap and driving. We only steer

# Trust Your Divine Advocate To Guide You

${ref}:27

  Lord I am not going to get up until you speak to me.
