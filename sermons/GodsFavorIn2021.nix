Exodus 33

# Intro 

Byron was told he was going to be the quarter back. He found favor in
the eyes of his coach. Don't we want to hear that from God? If we are
serious about walk with God we ought to desire the same.

Psalm 5:12

Who wouldn't want God's favor that acts as a shield around them.

Be sure that you have God's favor for this new year.

Exodus 33 unfolds how Moses received favor from God.

## Context

God says to Moses in ch 32:

> I've had it; I'm ticked; I'm ready to blow away this people.

and in ch 33:

> I will not go with your people. Because if I do go I will become so
> sick that I will destroy them. I will send an angel to drive out
> the Caananites but I will not go.
>
> - (Exodus 33:2)


When we live by the flesh, embrace sin, and greave the HS - God causes the
conscious in that person will wear them down. God placed the tabernacle outside
of the camp because He cannot have fellowship with sin. We see this here between
God and Israel - a NT concept illustracted in the OT.

Ex 33:12

# The Desire Of Fellowship and Knowing God

Reading between the lines this is a man (Moses) who desires God's favor. And in
order to find favor he must know God in a personal way.

know
: yada
: the Hiphil imperative - "cause me to know".

_Is your passion "God I must know you" this year?_

Paul said in Phil 3:10, 2 Pe 3:18 

Psalm 103:7

the "ways" were made known to Moses, but only the "acts" were made known to
Israel.

Again "know" here means a deep personal knowledge of God; "acts" refers to
superficial knowledge. Moses knew God from face to face encounters.

2 levels of knowledge: about the things of God, and who God is and why He does
the things He does. Some know God only by the works that He does. How many know
God personally? _Do you?_ The only way to know God is by:

* An addiction to knowing God. To seek Him out through His Word.

Incomprehensibility of God
: God cannot be finally and completely understood
: 1 Tim 6:16

_How do we develop this relationship without physically seeing a person_?

If we can completely know God then He is not God. The HS will teach you -
He will open your eyes to knowing Him. 

Don't just show me what you do, but why you do what you do; how you operate.
God doesn't do this by osmosis. This isn't theological stuff - but practical.
It will change you life.

Isa 54:10

Maybe you don't feel this? You feel God has abandonded you. What do you do?
Return to the chart and see the character of God.

Study and memorize the attributes of God.

# Seeking God's Guidance in All Things 

Ex 33:12

You have not let me know who will go with me. Moses here is seeking God's
guidance.

Judges 6 - Gideon was wanting to be absolutely sure what God's guidance was.
David was seeking out God's guidance (His Shepherd), as was Paul.

Why do we need to seek God's guidance?

1. It demonstrates dependence upon God - this becomes a lifelong process for
me.
1. It demonstrates obedience to God
1. It demonstrates my recognition of a fallen nature that keeps me often from
seeing things as God sees them. 

We all need a healthy respect, awareness, and distrust of the old nature - for
sometimes the very thing that feels right is not the thing we desire.

`Your ways != my ways`

Proverbs 3:5-6 Do not lean on your own understanding!

How to listen to God by Charles Stanley (p46).

Ever have the desire to see far ahead when you're stuck in traffic? If only
there were a plane that you could radio to navigate through or out of the
traffic? That is the way it is between us and God.


# Seek God's Presence in All Things

Ex 33:15-16

presence
: lit "show me your face"
: the sense of being in the immediate presence of God

you
: is not plural but singular
: 2nd person, masculine, singular

Why does God say this? Because He cannot have fellowship with sin

rest
: to pause
: to be left alone

God's rest is a result of our trusting Him. Whatever your circumstance is 
trust God - it's a moment by moment resting in God.

# Application

* Know that God wants a personal relationship with Him more than you want
it. 

* Know His presense has a common characteristic of rest, peace; pause.
