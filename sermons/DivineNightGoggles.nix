'' { title = "Divine Night Goggles - 1 Cor 2:6-14"; }''

# Intro

Pastor got to sit in an M1 tank - night vision goggles. With
these on one can see in the dark. When it comes to reading
God's word we often feel like we're in the dark. Emotionally
we're not recieving anything, mentally we are confused. 

However, the HS acts as our night goggles - giving us the ability
to see what we cannot see naturally. He holds the ministry
of _illumination_.

# Historical Background

Paul is commanding the believers to stop being enamored by the Greek
philosphers of the day. Emphasis was placed on how to speak eliquently.  For
example the sophists were philosophers who would wax eliquently about the
"logos". Essentially these were preachers who were watering down the Word of
God in order to make it more pallatable. Remember the Christians did not come
from the upper ends of the intellectual world.

# Man Requires the Help of the Holy Spirit To Understand The Things of God

1 Cor 1:26-29

sophia
: hebrew for wisdom
: used 7 times, 4 for wisdom of man, 3 times for wisdom of God in 2:6 it is
used regarding the wisdom of God taught to the mature

Infants of Christ vs mature in Christ

1 Cor 3:1

_True wisdom cannot be discovered by human thinking_. It's impossible for a
lesser creature to understand that of a greater. E.g. a flea doesn't understand
the mind of a man. _Men cannot understand God_.

> If this is true then why do we try and get to know God.
>
> Does this mean we are allowed to make truth claims about God?
>
> How does this affect our hermineutics that is how can one know what is true
>  about God if we are require the HS.

1 Cor 2:9

### Philosophies of the Day:

Imperism 
: knowledge can only come out of actual experience

rationalism
: belief that the exercise of reason provides the basis for knowledge
: if you cannot reason it then it must not be true
: disregards authority, divine revelation

gnosticism
: Matthew 11:25

appraised
: discernable 
: Influenced and guided by the Holy Spirit.

Watching tv on a 19" screen verses HD - but the 19" is connected to satalite -
and you're not. You may have high ability of human reasoning but without the 
HS you cannot understand the things of God.

1 Cor 2:10 - no person can know another person better than they know
themselves. Our deep thoughts are only known to ourselves. In a similar
way only the spirit of God can fully know the thoughts of God. I.e it takes
God within us to understand God the Father.

# The HS Reveals Divine Wisdom and Insight

illumination
: enlightenment

It causes the words on the page to bleed through and give us insight both into
what the passage means and also how it applies to our mind.

oida
: to know fully - both intellectually and spiritually

the HS goes deep thought fishing. He pulls out the deeper truths of God. Only
the Spirit filled man can do this - he must be walking in the flesh.

Examples:

  * something new jumps off the page
  * a perfect passage for our circumstances

John 14:26, 16:13

God's word promises that God's spirit will guide us into truth

Simple concepts that God has on the surface it is complicated and difficult to
understand. But then the HS comes and shows us how simple it is.

1 Jn 2:20 - you continue to have annointing
1 Jn 2:27 - the aorist tense we have already received the annointing.

This does not refer to a speaker who gives a dynamic message.

The annointing  is the HS: every Christian has the spriritual capacity to
understand the deeper things of God when we are walking by the Spirit. We all
have the same capacity to have intimacy with God. This is not only for the 
super Christians to hear from God.

Romans 11:33

1 Cor 2:16 - we have the mind of Christ: the Word and Spirit of God.

> "combines the spiritual things with those who are spiritual"
>
> - Philips Translation

2 Kings 6:15,16

1 Cor 2:15

appraises
: krino
: to separate; discern; divide

No one can know him but God! It is by the HS that believers obtain discernment.
Discernment vs not is like a man who is color blind. 

# Application

* Cleanse yourself - come clean. When you have sin in your life you cannot see
the deeper things of God
* Set yourself before God with a heart of obedience; have the desire to hear
from God 
* Diligently seek the mind of God through His word

See Charles Stanely - being empowered by the HS.
