<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Cliff Barrells story of meeting Billy Graham. What he thought was a flop turned out to be God’s providencial hand.</p>
<p>Romans 8:28 - “and”</p>
<h3 id="first-key-we-know">First Key: “we know”</h3>
<p>in present tense - habitual action. “And we are knowing”.</p>
<dl>
<dt>“know”</dt>
<dd>gnosko - a beginning knowledge
</dd>
<dd>epignosis - places emphasis on top of. “Knowledge ontop of knowledge”. Knowledge + an experience that drives that knowledge home.
</dd>
<dd>oida - Full, complete, and absolute knowledge. Includes prior two definitions
</dd>
</dl>
<p>“We have a continuing; absolute knowledge that we can rest in”.</p>
<p>You learn stuff - but then it becomes an experiencial truth which allows you to rest. Paul puts this statement in the form of an assumption. We should have this knowledge.</p>

<dd>synergism - working of elements together to produce an effect greater than and possibly different. Example: table salt: NaCl. 2 poisions = 1 inert compound.

<blockquote>
<p>All things work together for good to them who love God - KJV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This language implies the wrong idea. Not everything is for the good.</p>
<p><em>God causes all things…</em></p>
<p>The universe doesn’t work automatically - it is still under God’s control. Job 26:8-9, Col 1:16-17.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Providence is the hand of God in the glove of history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Romans 8:28 God is sovereign. He exercises His perogative to exercise whatever He wants.</p>
<p>Job 23:13</p>
<p>There is no such thing as chance, luck, or mistakes.</p>
<p>How do we translate this? I need to have complete confidence of God’s complete control over my life. This passage is not stating a larger benefit exists for every negative circumstance.</p>
<h2 id="comprehend-what-good-means">Comprehend What Good Means</h2>
<dl>
<dt>good</dt>
<dd>His purposes for our lives.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Romans 8:29 “For those whom he foreknew”: good means conforming to the image of Christ.</p>
<p>The first effect of a problem is a shock - a realization of a problem. We are ready to pay attention to a problem. What is dangerous is when everything is going smoothly. Trials put our eyes back onto the Lord. One doesn’t go to the doctor until there is pain in their life.</p>
<p>It is the storm that cause us to look tot he light house of God’s Word.</p>
<p>The weaker I am the more the power of God can be released. God puts pain into our lives to get us to walk closer to Him and correct the sin in our lives.</p>
<p>Genesis 50:19-20</p>
<h2 id="comprehend-who-are-those-who-love-god">Comprehend Who Are Those Who Love God</h2>
<p>“those who love God” - this doesn’t mean ALL believers. It’s not a subjective statement. You cannot just say “Yeah I think I love God”.</p>
<p>Do you love God? The real God - not the god of your imagination or feelings. We all go around in our culture and avoid this book [the Bible].</p>
<p>If I don’t love the God of this book then I love the God of my imagination.</p>
<p>Psalm 50:21 - God said “you thought I was like you but you are wrong”. We project our ideas values and preferences on God.</p>
<p>There is emotion in worship - but it cannot be just that.</p>
<p>John 14:21 - those who love God keep His commandments. Love is always practical - it is always willing to sacrifice it for Him.</p>
<p>Daniel and the lions den. <em>Our love is proven through trials more than what we feel and think.</em></p>
<p>Should we accept only good from God and not the bad? Though He should slay me I will trust Him!</p>

<li><p>who directs “all things”</p></li>
<li><p>what “good” means</p></li>
<li><p>who “are those who love God”.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure you have a Biblical love</p></li>
<li><p>Trust in God’s management of All things</p></li>
