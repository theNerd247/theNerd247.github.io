## Intro

Cliff Barrells story of meeting Billy Graham. What he thought was a flop
turned out to be God's providencial hand.

${ref}:28 - "and"

### First Key: "we know"

in present tense - habitual action. "And we are knowing".

"know"
: gnosko - a beginning knowledge
: epignosis - places emphasis on top of. "Knowledge ontop of knowledge".
Knowledge + an experience that drives that knowledge home.
: oida - Full, complete, and absolute knowledge. Includes prior two definitions

"We have a continuing; absolute knowledge that we can rest in".

You learn stuff - but then it becomes an experiencial truth which allows you to
rest. Paul puts this statement in the form of an assumption. We should have
this knowledge.

## Comprehend Who Directs All Things

together
: synergeo
: synergism - working of elements together to produce an effect greater than
and possibly different. Example: table salt: NaCl. 2 poisions = 1 inert
compound.

> All things work together for good to them who love God
> - KJV

This language implies the wrong idea. Not everything is for the good.

_God causes all things..._


The universe doesn't work automatically - it is still under God's control.
Job 26:8-9, Col 1:16-17.

> Providence is the hand of God in the glove of history.

In ${ref}:28 God is sovereign. He exercises His perogative to exercise whatever
He wants.

Job 23:13

There is no such thing as chance, luck, or mistakes. 

How do we translate this? I need to have complete confidence of God's complete
control over my life.  This passage is not stating a larger benefit exists for
every negative circumstance.

## Comprehend What Good Means

good
: His purposes for our lives.

${ref}:29 "For those whom he foreknew": good means conforming to the image of
Christ.

The first effect of a problem is a shock - a realization of a problem. We are
ready to pay attention to a problem. What is dangerous is when everything is
going smoothly. Trials put our eyes back onto the Lord. One doesn't go to the
doctor until there is pain in their life.

It is the storm that cause us to look tot he light house of God's Word.

The weaker I am the more the power of God can be released. God puts pain into
our lives to get us to walk closer to Him and correct the sin in our lives.

Genesis 50:19-20

## Comprehend Who Are Those Who Love God

"those who love God" - this doesn't mean ALL believers. It's not a subjective
statement. You cannot just say "Yeah I think I love God".

Do you love God? The real God - not the god of your imagination or feelings. We
all go around in our culture and avoid this book [the Bible].

If I don't love the God of this book then I love the God of my imagination.

Psalm 50:21 - God said "you thought I was like you but you are wrong". We
project our ideas values and preferences on God.

There is emotion in worship - but it cannot be just that. 

John 14:21 - those who love God keep His commandments. Love is always practical
- it is always willing to sacrifice it for Him.

Daniel and the lions den. _Our love is proven through trials more than what we
feel and think._ 

Should we accept only good from God and not the bad? Though He should slay me I
will trust Him!

## Application

Comprehend:

  * who directs "all things"
  * what "good" means
  * who "are those who love God".

* Be sure you have a Biblical love
* Trust in God's management of All things
