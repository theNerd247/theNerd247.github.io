# The Assurance In Salvation

I have a deep fear of death and I'm amazed at how well you can sleep.  There
was a lack of assurance of salvation - often a person's feelings play into
this. 

''(quote ''
No one had need to ask if they had recieved the Holy Spirit. Fire is evident;
so is power.

''{p = "Romans 8";}''

There is therefore no no no condemnation from the love of God.

''(r data.p)'':15 those who are loved by God are sons of God. Only those who
are led by the spirit. 

He can only make claim to what he has done; not what God has done. A Christian
boasts in what God has done. The sons of God are secure in Christ - even if
they are not as obedient as they should be. This does not mean they will feel
like it. One who neglects obedience, study, and/or fellowship they will most
always question their salvation. Fear is the enemy's way to prevent Christ from
living out His life within you.

How do we determine how he (the Holy Spirit) leads us?  Romans 8:13 

  - He leads by giviing us victory over the flesh.
  - If you are becoming more and more like Christ.
  - You lose the appetite for fulfilling the sinful nature.
  - When I see I am moving from a self-directed; spirit directed life I am a
  child of God
  - By freeing us from the spirit of slavery that will almost always lead to a
  spirit of fear.

No matter how much we mask our unbelieving reality the non-christian is
constantly living in fear. When you give in 

''(code "" ''
  Guilt -> Fear (Of judgement, of God)
'')''

Even the believer who gives into sin: we blow it and blow it over and over
until we finally start asking: "where is God in all of this?".


Hebrews 2:14-18, 2 Tim 1:7, 1 John 4:15-18, Galatians 4:1-7

If we are saved and mature in Christ then we do not live by fear.

The most miserable person on earth is the carnal Christian.

The law was a task master leading one to become a believer.

adoption
: a pronouncement of becoming an adult with all the rights of privileges.
: being placed as a son within a family

patria potestas
: the roman father had the complete authority over his family

You as a child of God should not be fearful but confident - and not timid. You
have all the rights of the Father. You are partners with Christ (business
partners?) and have the ability to withdraw from the divine bank without limit
whether of frequency or amount. We often fail to recognize the lofy position
we have in Christ - not in arrogance but with confidence in Christ.

John 1:12

right
: authority, power
: exousia

When you have this understanding you will address Him as "Daddy" who desires
the best for you. The Spirit Himself testifies with our Spirit. Romans 8:17

There had to be seven witnesses when an adoption occured. The Spirit of God
bears witness to us. The sign of a son of God is someone who is an heir of God
the Father and joint heir with Christ. A child has a potential of inheriting
something. A Roman father would never refer to a son as his son until he
reached the age of maturity; before then he was a child. This is the picture
shown here.

An heir
: one who recieves part of the division of the inheritance. 

A joint heir
: one who recieves the whole of the shared inheritance.
: a co-owner of the inheritance

What role does the Holy Spirit play in our assurance? He bears witness to us
that we are sons of the living God.
