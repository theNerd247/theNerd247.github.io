<h1 id="a-new-kind-of-life">A New Kind Of Life</h1>
<p>Eph 5:18</p>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>We have resident in each of us God’s heart, we have all the resources we need and yet believers live as if they are living on empty.</p>
<p>Have you lost hope that your life (Christian) is not what it is what you want it to be? Do you struggle with the same sin or worthless feeling with no avail?</p>
<p>Yes they may believe God will help them but what does that really mean? We believe</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God helps those who help themselves”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are little difference between the habits of the believer and the secular man. Guilt is usually the main motivator for obedience and thus is usually short lived. One of the great dangers of the Christian life is that we grow complacent and we lose the passion for Jesus! Our greatest fear is that we become a wicked old man - calloused and unpleasant.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-commanded-to-be-filled">We are Commanded To Be Filled</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Eph 5:14</dt>
<dd>quote out of OT
</dd>
<dt>death</dt>
<dd>separated from God
</dd>
<dd>Practically - a ho-hum complacent Christian life
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Eph 5:15-16 be:</p>
<ul>
<li>wise</li>
<li>redeem the time “Therefore [to do the above] do not be foolish <em>but</em> understand what the will of the LORD is.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Eph 5:18 This is a command! Each believer is to be filled with the Spirit. He’s not saying “This would be a great idea if you would just let the HS control you”.</p>
<p><em>God is not into suggestions but commands</em>.</p>
<p>There is no command to be baptized, sealed, or indwelled by the HS.</p>
<dl>
<dt>filled</dt>
<dd>present tense (keep on being filled)
</dd>
<dd>in plural (Y’all be filled) it is meant for all Christians
</dd>
<dd>Grk: “pleroo”
</dd>
<dd>power or control that is to be had. Often spoken of the wind filling the sails of a ship.
</dd>
<dd>lit. filling a cup
</dd>
<dd>see John 16:6, Luke 4:28, Acts 13:45
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="it-is-meant-for-all-believers">It is meant for all believers</h2>
<p>You cannot see the HS but you can see the effects of the HS. He is like electricity - He is always there, but you have to tap into Him. Without the Spirit controlling us life can become a hassle.</p>
<p>How often do we look at other believers and say “What a spiritual giant!” why can’t I be like that? When the HS fills a particular believer He manifests His works in a way that is tied closely with that person’s natural gifts and personality/temperament.</p>
<p><img src="./InChrist.svg" /> Ministries of HS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indwelt</li>
<li>Sealed</li>
<li>baptized One can resist the filling ministry of the HS, but you cannot do the filling yourself. When we allow the HS to control us we can do things we never would have imagined.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot fill something that is already filled. If you already are filling your life with things that soothe your deep longing the HS cannot fill within you. Sadly Christians too often are trying to fill their life with things that bring no long term solution.</p>
<p>Because of the present tense.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-a-continuous-experience">This is a continuous experience</h2>
<p>The filling of the HS. Life depletes that ministry in our lives.</p>
<p>Even though it is a continuous action, do not believe that because you are not being filled then He leaves you. “If I’ve done such and such horrible thing then He would leave me”. You <strong>must DAILY activate the filling of the HS</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-a-matter-of-control">It Is A Matter of Control</h2>
<p>This isn’t just an indwelling, but a controlling. A drunk person is controlled by alcohol, a HS filled person is controlled by the HS.</p>
<dl>
<dt>drunk</dt>
<dd>riotousness or rowdiness such that almost a different person is exhibited.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The man who is filled acts in ways that are unnatural to Him. <em>The controlling of the HS removes all excuses in one’s life</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>my personality - don’t blame your sin nature on God.</li>
<li>this is how I was raised - God can change you</li>
<li>I’ve always been this way - you have not known fully what it is to be guided fully.</li>
</ul>
<p>God plants His heart into our lives. Instead of spending our time and energy to change ourselves we should spend our times learning how to be filled. A drunk need only to take a drink to be drunk</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-activate-the-spirits-filling">How do I activate the Spirit’s filling?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be totally dependent upon God: embrace the essential element of total dependence. John 15: apart from me you can do Nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The spirit filled life begins when we are absolutely convinced we can do nothing apart from the HS. When we reveal we are completely hopeless! Without meaning to Christians live without God’s spirit in their daily lives. When they fail they get back up and say “I’ll try harder next time”.</p>
<p>What is surrender?</p>
<p><img src="./Surrender.svg" /> Isaiah 53:6. Because we have this old nature we are all rebels at heart.</p>
<p>The problem with a living sacrifice is that it keeps crawling off the alter.</p>
<p>The start of filling is often brokenness.</p>
<p>The danger is that there is some formula for filling - but the reality is that the filling comes when we live a day-by-day surrendered life.</p>
