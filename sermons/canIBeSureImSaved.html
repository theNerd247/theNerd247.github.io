<h1 id="can-i-be-sure-im-saved">Can I Be Sure I’m Saved?</h1>
<p><em>Dr. Byron Morgan</em></p>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Romans 8:28-30</p>
<p>How do I know that I’m saved?</p>
<p>Others fear that they have done something that causes us to lose our salvation and live on eggshells.</p>
<p>v31.</p>
<p>“these things” refers to the same “things” in v32.</p>
<h1 id="i-am-assured-by-my-love-of-god">I am assured by my love of God</h1>
<p>“those who love God” - this is not a warm fuzzy thing we get (not a spiritual high). This is evidence (proof) that we are saved. 1 John 4:19. God first loved us, and then we loved Him. If I’m obedient to Him then I want to please Him and that shows that I love Him.</p>
<p>2 types of love in marriage:</p>
<ul>
<li>One spouse is conditional in their love and the other constantly attempts to gain the approval of the other person.</li>
<li>The other type of love is the opposite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Romans 8:28,30</p>
<h1 id="am-i-assured-by-gods-call">Am I assured by God’s call</h1>
<p>There is indeed a call to ministry - however this is not the calling noted in v30.</p>
<p>2 Peter 3:9</p>
<dl>
<dt>Universalism</dt>
<dd>everyone will eventually come to Christ.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can we honestly I am what I am by God’s grace? Are there things in my life that can only be explained by the supernatural?</p>
<p>What are your interests these days? Is it to know Christ? Is it to participate in the growth of God’s kingdom?</p>
<p>What has made you what you are? Are you convicted by sin? Conviction is like an annoying smoke alarm. 1 Thes 2:13</p>
<h1 id="i-am-assured-by-gods-purpose-for-me">I am assured by God’s purpose for me</h1>
<dl>
<dt>“foreknew”</dt>
<dd>doesn’t mean predetermine, predestine, or foreordination
</dd>
<dd>pros (before) * ginosko (knowledge)
</dd>
<dt>“predestine”</dt>
<dd>to markout set a boundary
</dd>
</dl>
<p>God, before the foundation of the world, has marked out a plan of redemption for us. For example, a soccer coach already determines what plays and team movement is to occur and so he sets up practices to direct the team to do this.</p>
<p>Romans 8:29 - Jesus was the first born of several brothers. We are conformed to the image of Christ because we are brothers; we have the same DNA.</p>
<p><img src="./inChrist.svg" /> Romans 8:30</p>
<h1 id="i-am-assured-by-my-justification">I am assured by my justification</h1>
<p>3 things God could have done to address sin:</p>
<ul>
<li>issue verdict leaving us hopeless (condem all)</li>
<li>comprimise justice and lower the standard</li>
<li>provide a means to forgive sinners</li>
</ul>
<p>Romans 3:21-22</p>
<p>God doesn’t grade our righteousness on a curve - infact there isn’t even a scale: it’s a binary scale.</p>
<p>2 Cor 5:21</p>
<p>Justification doesn’t mean “not guilty” but more: you are completely righteous before God.</p>
<h1 id="iam-assured-by-my-glorification">Iam assured by my glorification</h1>
<p>Romans 8:30 - you are glorified.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:18,21,23 Paul is talking about what will happen to us during the millenial.</p>
<p>But in Romans 8:30 is a timeless statement - in God’s plan it is already considered done (modus ponens?).</p>
<h1 id="application">Application</h1>
<ul>
<li>Go on facts not feelings</li>
<li>This week think on this: Christ has a lot invested in you…. He is not going to give up on you now. There’s nothing you can do to make Him displeased.</li>
</ul>
