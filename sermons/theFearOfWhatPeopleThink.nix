"# "{title = "The Fear Of What People Think - Luke 12";}''

# Intro 

Fear and Anxiety plays an important role in other people's
lives.

Fear paralyzes. A person cannot become all that God has planned for them
to become if they live by their fear of other people. There's a fasade
when we live this way. We live in a way that makes them think what we
want them to think of us.

How do I combat being a phony? How do I live without fear of other people.

mirad
: myrios
: ten thousands

Speaking of the pharisees Jesus said that there's no way to cover up the stench
of a rotten egg.

hypocrocy
: to act or judge behind the mask
: hupocrino 

crino
: to judge

why does he use the word leaven? It refers to yeast. Before baking the leaven
was set in a dark cool place that allowed the yeast to permiate the dough. To
the Jews it always symoblized evil. Here Jesus uses the same symoblism to state
that the hypocrosy of the pharisees is evil. See Galations where Paul uses this
to speak of Jewish Christians still trying to live by the law.


Types of Pharisees:

1. Shoulder - wears his merrits on his shoulder for all to see
1. Wait a little - hang around a little to gather a crowd to show off
1. Bleeding - he closes his eyes and runs into walls to avoid lust
1. Painted - advertises his holiness to avoid touching unclean things. "Don't
touch me I'm holy!"

3/4 in steal rotted and only 39 coats of paint remained. Be careful to not
paint the outside. The art of concealment.

It's typically not loud or brash - but subtle, and insidious. It's incremental
and quiet.

# Resist The Lure of Hypocrisy

Run from the lure to not be honest with people. There's a gap between what we
say and what we are. There's typically a gap between what you know and what you
do. We are talking about the people who consciously hide who they are and how
they feel. Take the cultural Christian: they fake reading their Bible and
worship but there's no heart or passion.

Jesus did not waste warnings: he only had 3 years of ministry. Whenever He said
beware he was serious! Hypocrisy is subtle and real. It will creep in if given 
the chance.

Take Peter for example in Galatians 2:11. Gal 1:10 "Am I still trying to please
man?! If I were trying to please man I would not be a servant of Christ!"

We are not called to live for the audience of people. We are to order our lives
to the audience of 1: God the Father.

Everything which is hidden will be brought to the light:

  * Luke 12:2-3
  * Ecc 12:14 
  * Romans 2:16, 
  * 1 Cor 4:5

# Be Cognizant Of Your Eternal Accountability

John 5:27 

At the Great White Throne. All unbelievers will be judged for their rejection
of Jesus Christ. 

The Behma seat is where every believer will stand before Christ who will give
the final review of our lives. It may be "well done" for other he may say
"there was so much I had for your life". 


There won't be tears in heaven but there will be dissappointment. 1 Cor 3:12.

Men do not fear God because they fear man too much.

Luke 12:2-3 if what I say in private will be revealed then I need to have my heart
cleaned.

# Do Everything With Transparent Integrity

integrity
: Do what is right when no one is looking

1 Tim 1:5

sincere
: unhpycritical faith

Timothy struggled - perhaps - with fear of people. His love comes from a pure
heart and a clean conscience.

1 Pet 1:22.

God doesn't want us to live a perfect life -  but an authentic life

Phil 4: "Let your progress be made known to all men."

# Application

  * There must be an awareness to the temptation to be authentic. "My Father
  loves me with Grace; imperfect as I am. He walks with me!"
  * Reject the fear! "Why am I fearing?"
  * Determine to live out an authentic lifestyle.
