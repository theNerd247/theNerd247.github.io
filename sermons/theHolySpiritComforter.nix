## Intro

You are better off with Christ now, yesterday, tomorrow and for eternity.  You
know of His love, joy, and peace, and eternity to come.  Without Christ there
is uncertainty, no purpose, no peace, and eternal suffering.

What if someone said "You are better off without Christ"? This was said by
Christ himself. 

John 16:7:advantage
: profit

Christ left in order to send us His own Spirit to each of us. His Spirit is not
bound by space or time and thus can be omnipresent. Like a heart transplant, we
have the heart of Christ beating in us. 

2 Peter 1:4 - God has planted his Spirit in us. The more you feast on God's
promises and His Word then the more you begin to partake and activate the
divine nature in your life.

John 14:17:know
: experiential knowledge
: or "you know by experience"

Herein lies the problem: 2 extremes today. 

1. An over emphasis on the HS to the
  detriment of the person of Christ. We tend to equate the H.S with emotions.
  The HS is not isomorphic to feelings. Yes, He may affect our feelings, but
  not always.

2. Many do not give more then lip service to the HS in their lives. There are
many Church goers who have not experienced God in their lives. The benchmark of
success has become more about attendance and entertainment. It filled our
churches with self focused consumers rather than the self-sacrificing tombs.

Many believers live powerless lives.

## Recap

The HS renews and restores the believer's life so that He may change the
world. You are not just here to enjoy the good life.

## How will the Holy Spirit Guide Our lives?

2 words are the key to understanding this passage:

John 16:8:convict
: to convince or refute

John 16:7:Helper
: parakletos
: one who stands beside
: to summon exhort encourage, comfort

A councilor is one who comes alongside another to convince them of truth and
walk beside the person they council. However, many read this and think the HS's
purpose is to come down on the unbelievers to convict them of their sin.

The reason for many Christian's pain is they are living life outside of
reality. The nature of sin is to ignore the one in charge of sin. `John 16:9 -
sin = unbelief.`

1. The help believers make known man's greatest sin: that of not believing in
Christ. John 3:18. The purpose of convincing is not to condemn the world in
self righteousness but to stand alongside them and say - in gentle spirit -
"Hey, let me show you what God has done in my life." They are not the enemy,
but a victim of the enemy (Satan). When you go the movies they show you
previews to get you to see them. As a believer you are a preview into the
eternal kingdom of God. Being a witness is a great privilege but also a great
responsibility.

1. To help believers reveal the righteousness of Christ. John 16:10 - the
righteousness of God. We speak of who Christ is. 

  sin
  : harmatia
  : to miss the mark
  : an arrow missing the bullseye

  God does not grade on a curve. Isaiah 64:6

''(indent 2 (table 
  [ "Man" "Christ" ]
  [["-R" "R +INF"]
   ["+R" "-R & R +INF"]
  ]
))''

  Romans 4 "He who knew no sin..."

1. We are to help believers (by the aid of the HS) to make known the judgement
that is to come.
  John 16:11:judged
  : perfect tensed
  : at the Cross Satan was judged and continues to be judged.

  Satan is still hanging around because the sentence hasn't been carried out
  yet. There is a judgement to come because Satan has been judged.

## Application

1. A primary purpose of the believer is to help the unbeliever see Christ
1. The HS will bring conviction in our lives
1. The successful Christian in this world depends on the HS in our lives.

Going back to the heart transplant analogy: _God says "I want to hear my heart
beating strongly in you"_.
