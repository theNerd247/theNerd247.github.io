# Intro

John 15

Imagine that you're going to buy a birthday gift for a pre-schooler.
You ask a toy-store cashier for advice and are taken to a toy truck
aisle. The toy requires are required to have batteries - which are 
included in the in truck.

The child recieves the gift and begins to play with the toy as if it
had no batteries. These are like Christians who live as if they never
recieved the Holy Spirit. They are trying to live the Christian life
on their own efforts; the live their life as if they were weaned on a
dill pickle and eventually give up and walk away from their relationship
with God.

Eph 5:18 
: this is one of the few passages that uses active tense when talking about the
H.S. Normally the aorist tense is used. Filling is to be a continuous and involved
process by both the person and the H.S.

1 Cor 2:14 - 3:4

note:

  * spiritual man (spirit filled)
  * fleshly / carnal man (not spirit filled)
  * merely human (the unbeliever)

E.g a "giving man" is one who is characterized by his giving. In likewise a
spirit filled man is characterized by the working of the Holy Spirit; the
fleshly man is characterized by the acts of the flesh.

John 15 is in similar vain - to be continuously filled/controlled by the Holy
Spirit.

''(sideNote ''Be careful with complacency when studying scripture. God illuminates
our hearts and fresh bread is awaiting us. God's word speaks - we come together
to hear God speak. The job of the preacher is that of a waiter: to get the food to the
table without messing up the food.'')''

"I am"
: speaks of the eternality of Jesus; His pre-existance of God that He existed
before all time.
: lit. "Ego eimi"
: lit. "I I am" - akin to the OT statement "I am that I am". This is a
declarative statement.

"I am the true vine".  Jesus uses word pictures that are relavant to the men he
is speaking to. The vine used to represent Israel.

true
: genuine, authentic, real
: aletheinos

abide
: meno
: to remain, stay in place
: constative aorist 

constative aorist
: the totality of the action - your life style.

"he who constantly abides in me". The picture is that in order for the branch
to live it must stay connected to the Holy Spirit's power in your life.

When Jesus asks "where are you staying" he uses the word "meno" which means to
abide. 

# Know that Christ Expects Us To Bear Fruit

bear fruit
: the result of abiding.  
: see Gal 5:22 - 23 (note fruit is singular)

Fruit of the Spirit:

  * love
  * joy
  * peace
  * patience
  * kidness
  * goodness
  * faithfulness
  * gentleness
  * self-control

_Why is this not only seeing others come to Christ?_


Why does the fruit of the spirit not work for some? He doesn't expect us to
_produce_ the fruit but to _bear_ the fruit. Our only verbal command is to
abide - He is the one that produces the fruit in our lives.

''(sideNote ''What's the difference between "produce" and "bear" fruit?'')''

We get frustrated in our lives - and a major part of the problem is that we are
trying to produce the fruit.

Gal 2:20 we get burdened down because we get frustrated.

Poodle says he is greater than a german shephard. The german shephard
disagreed.  They made a contest to open the door. The german shephard uses all
his might and after 3 minutes opens the door. The poodle walks up to the other
door - whines and scratches and the owner opens the door. This is a picture
between the believer running on his own strength and the one who is connected
to the Master. The believer must rest and grow in his relationship with God. It
is then that Christ changes his heart and mind and out of that produces the
fruit in the believers life.

# Understand the Christian life is impossible

"Without me you can do _nothing_." Keep in mind that the disciples anticipated
that something big was going to happen; they were fearful. Christ knew how
dependent they were on Him. Christ was saying: "You need to be just as
dependent on who I'm sending as you are on me today". He knew how wandering
(like sheep) they were and would try and live by their own power. God knew 
how self-powering we are. 

The Holy Spirit is the divine sap giver. He is the abiding abiding presence of 
God in your life. "It is no longer I who lives but Christ who lives within me".
In Romans 7 Paul wasn't saying that He was falling into gross sin but that he
was having a hard time living out the Christian life. 

''(sideNote ''For accountability the emphasis should be placed on our abiding
in Christ - not in avoiding the sin'')''

Imagine one who has no musical ability and tries out for the lead role in a
musical.  The director mentions that she is tone-deaf and confronts her. She
says "Oh please let me have it anyway. I'll practice really hard - everyday. I
know I don't deserve it but let me at a chance". She doesn't realize that she
doesn't have the natural talent it's impossible for her to.

''(digraph ''

"Abiding in Christ" -> "Fruit of the Spirit"
"Abiding in Christ" -> "Avoiding Sin"
"Abiding in Christ" -> "Witnessing"
"Abiding in Christ" -> "Helping the poor"
"Abiding in Christ" -> "Healing from damaged emotions"
"Abiding in Christ" -> "Reconciliation"

'')''

Sin is _not_ the root of the problem but the symptom. We are living out our
lives independent of our relationship with God.  We have to have faith that 
when we abide in Christ and trust that He will produce the fruit in us

# Realize that No On abides without faith

Going back to the singer analogy. Imagine that a doctor says "we are going
to replace your vocal chords to make you sing like the best of them". That's
what God says to us. He is going to give us batteries that are so powerful
that will change your life and produce unbelievable power. But you have to
get out of the way and just rest in me.

Phil 4:9

can do
: In all things I am continuing to be strong in Him who is continuing to
empower me. 
: Gal 2:20

Spirit filled life. If you never learn to abide in Christ you will never have
sufficient self-control to resist temptation. 

# How do I have a Spirit filled life?

1. Confess your sins. You cannot be empowered if you have _unconfessed_ sin
(_not lack of  sin_).
1. Surrender your life to the vine
1. By faith believe that you're connected to the vine and thus, the vine will
give you life and power.

_Trust me! And watch me work!_
