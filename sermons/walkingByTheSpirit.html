<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>What do we do when we’re offended? Any form of hurt is grief. There is a sense of loss, they feel rejected and thus a loss to their self worth or percieved esteem. Have you thought that maybe we grieve God the Holy Spirit?</p>
<p>That’s what the Bible says. There are things that we do that grieves Him and thus prevents His power from manifesting itself in our lives.</p>
<p>Remember that God wants to hear His heart beating strongly in our lives.</p>
<p>Many Christians live powerless lives in regards to the H.S:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They don’t know the provision of power that God has layed at their finger tips. We forget that God has put His very nature in us or we don’t understand what that means.</li>
<li>They never learn how to activate the Spirit’s power in their lives. They have a Christian life with no heart in it.</li>
<li>They see the Christian life as being one emotional high as the next. The H.S does bring emotions. It is the <em>fruit</em> (not “fruits”) of the spirit. Gal 5:22-23 gives the fruit: virtues that enable one to live an exceptional and extraordinary life.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="./factFaithFeelings.svg" /> We should not base our Christian life on feelings - but fact.</p>
<p>Eph 5:18</p>
<p>The secret to the Christian life is being controlled and filled with the spirit.</p>
<dl>
<dt>filled</dt>
<dd>plerao
</dd>
<dd>speaks of being controlled continuously.
</dd>
<dd>like wind in a sailboat
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If God commands this then why do I need it? Just like how wine controls a drunk man so is how one who is filled with the Spirit is out of his natural character; he is controlled by the H.S. Gal 5:22 the fruit produced in us must come from a power source.</p>
<p>The Christian life isn’t difficult, but impossible. You cannot live it in the flesh. So how do you activate that power source?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter in a relationship with God</li>
<li>Embrace total dependence on God. It begins with an overwhelming realization that we are helpless. What keeps us from coming to that place? Pride. We try and do it on our own.</li>
<li>Recognize that God uses brokeness to bring about surrender and wipe our pride out the door.</li>
</ol>
<p>What impedes the Spirit’s work in our lives?</p>
<p>Eph 4:30</p>
<p>The word grieve is a love word. <em>You cannot grieve someone that doesn’t love you</em>.</p>
<h1 id="recognize-the-spirits-feelings.-eph-430">Recognize the Spirit’s feelings. Eph 4:30,</h1>
<p>Eph 1:13</p>
<dl>
<dt>sealed</dt>
<dd>once; for all.
</dd>
<dd>a wax seal used to declare: a transaction was finished (like a notary), ownership, create security.
</dd>
<dd>Our salvation is complete, God owns us, and we are secure in Him.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you have trusted Christ by faith you cannot lose your salvation but you can block His fellowship.</p>
<p>If you find yourself an unhappy Christian then it could be that something within you is grieving the Holy Spirit. When He is pleased with your walk then He is released within your life.</p>
<p>What causes one to grieve the Holy Spirit?</p>
<p>Eph 4:22</p>

<dt>lay aside</dt>

<dd>Put it away from you and don’t pick it back up!

<dd>The idea is of taking off dirty clothes and putting them in the hamper.

<p>Romans 6:6. Stop being slaves today. When we sin, God doesn’t change; we have moved.</p>
<p>Things that grieve the Holy Spirit (applied to the church at Ephesus):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dishonesty. Our old father was Satan (John 8:44)</li>
<li>Cheating / Stealing. We as believers should work as unto the Lord.</li>
<li>Rotten speech. Gossip, being critical, judging someone</li>
<li>Malice, wrath, slander. All forms of anger manifested in a sinful way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember we could hurt the feelings of Christ and the Holy Spirit.</p>
