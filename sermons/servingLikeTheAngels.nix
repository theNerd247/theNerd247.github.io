# ''{ title = "Serving Like The Angels - Luke 2:8-14"; }''

## Intro

A child saw a man stop cars from wrecking - possibly an angel?

The only way we will understand life is by aligning our lives with the 
perfect life. We can only be saved by having the righteousness (+R) of
Christ.

hypostatic union
: Christ being fully God and fully man - the God + man savior
: see Phil 2 - "He emptied Himself" thus giving up his independent use of His
divine attributes.

What are the Christmas presents should we bring to the King of Kings? 

We don't think of Angels that often - especially during our daily lives.
However, angels are ubiquitous throughout scripture - 214 in OT 186 in NT (300
in total).

### Context of Angels 

1. They are a creation of God - just like man was created by God. Ps. ???

1. They are invisible - spirits. They are not ghosts (demons impersonating
people).  Computers have hardware + software (visible + invisible). Humans have
visible (body) and invisible (soul + spirit). Angels can be thought of software
only. They have the invisible (spirit) but not the hardware (body).

1. They are made to bring credit to God. Col 1:16. They were created before the
foundation of the world. 

1. They were created holy and righteous (good angels that is. The bad ones are
demons).

1. They are more powerful than humans. They can transport through physical
space instintaneously.

## The Angels Tell Us About the Gift of Service

Luke 2:8-14. To whom did the angels appear? Shepherds.

Revelation 4:5

The creatures before the throne - seraphim - were angels. 

Rev 10:1 - this is an angel that is high up in God's pecking order.

Hebrews 1:14 - the angels are ministring spirits meant to serve those who
are to inherit salvation.

These angels are going to stinky heards men to give great news. What does this
teach us? They were willing to serve - though powerful - to do God's will.

### We serve as a gift of selflessness 

_Never be to big to serve others_. You are not more important to serve other
people.

People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.

Submit yourselves to one another - Eph 5.

I care enough to submit to you and let you be a part of my life and me a part
of yours.

diakonia
: to serve tables
: rendered as "deacon" today.

Remember how a menial task this must have been to come down and give this news
to shepherds.

Walt Disney was a genius. No one was referred to as "workers" they were "cast
members". You're an actor and everyone picks up trash.

Gal 6:10 - _serve others_. Focus on, this Christmas, on how you can serve
Christ through a selflessness way. Think about some of the people around
you and see who you can serve. How many times do we say "pray for me" vs "how 
can I pray for you"? If God hates pride what do you think He thinks about
selflessness?

It's easy to get bogged down this season about COVID and presents and family
meetings.

## Serve as a Gift of Love

Luke 2:10

Did God need to use angels to bring this message? Couldn't He use his audible
voice?  Yes, but He chose to enlist his servants the angels.

If you want to love me then go serve these people.

1 John 3:16

You can't buy God anything. You can't improve the perfect triune God. v17 says
that we serve God and get Him a gift by serving and sacrificing our lives
towards those around us.

Psalm 50 - if God had a need we wouldn't ask us to fill it. He creates needs 
within people around us and then asks us to serve them.

We slow God up - the angels too. Think of a runner who is a pro running with
you.  You are slowing them down and they aren't getting any benefit from
running with you.  God could snap His finger and all problems could be solved! 
So why does He not do this? He is saying to each of us - "I want to give you the
privilege by serving those who are my children".

## Serve as A Gift of Worship

Luke 2:13-14

God is pleased only with those who have trusted Him; it is those people who
have received peace.

Romans 12:1 - this represents all of us. You surrender; crawl up on the alter,
and give your life over to God. 

* Pray for them
* Meals to them
* Be inconvenienced for them
* Give them your ear

I care about being the Good News to someone this season. Serve others!

## Application

* God help me to be the good news this Christmas - to understand that life
isn't about me but others.
* God help me to find those people who are in need and then to have a heart
to serve Him.
