<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Have you ever had anyone say to you “Hey, you are skating on thin ice!”.</p>
<p>As adults we’ve all experienced the feeling that we’re on thin ice. We prefer to say it like:</p>
<ul>
<li>My marriage is failing</li>
<li>my work situation is disintigrating</li>
<li>the bottom is falling out of my financial life</li>
</ul>
<p>We all at times struggle with uncertainty.</p>
<p>However, God’s love for us is certain. That truth is biblically portrayed in the Psalms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God is my refuge and my fortress. He is a shelter for me”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God’s love is like an aircraft carrier in our life. It gives us incomparable peace and security in our lives.</p>
<p>Proverbs 20:6</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who talk about their loyalty but rarely are there those who will keep their commitment.</p>
<p>God’s unchanging nature makes it impossible for Him to ever give us insecurity.</p>
<h1 id="what-am-i-to-think-about-gods-love-during-adversity">What am I to Think about God’s love during adversity?</h1>
<p>Romans 8:35</p>
<p>This chapter ends the first doctrinal section of the new testament.</p>

<p>Can any of the above separate us from God’s salvation for us? Romans 8:37. Absolutely not!!!</p>
<p>Jer 31:3</p>
<p>Paul re-assures us of God’s love Romans 8:36 by referencing Psalm 44:22. He is saying that God’s people should’t be surprised that we will suffer.</p>

<dt>loved</dt>
<dd>in aorist tense (a point in time)
</dd>
<dd>This is pointing right back to the cross.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Christ’s victory on the cross ensures our victory in life. When we have a trial often we get and stay discouraged. 1 Cor 10:13. God will provide a way to escape.</p>
<p>Trials shouldn’t be walking over us; we should be walking over our trials.</p>
<p>We get into a pull of gravity and we see ourselves as loosers. “I am a victor! I don’t have to give into this”.</p>
<p>“God I know this feeling isn’t true. And I am holding onto your promises and I trust that you will get me through this”.</p>
<p>Romans 8:38: these are theats in the spiritual world.</p>

<p>Hymn: <em>It is well with my soul</em>: “Teach me to say it is well with my soul” was changed to “Teach me to know it is well with my soul”.</p>
<p>Knowledge is the instrument panel on that spiritual airplane that gets us through the opaque clouds.</p>

<p>Romans 8:39</p>
