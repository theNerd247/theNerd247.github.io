Fear causes us to do irrational things.

There are things we should fear

Heb 4:1

Why should I fear God? What is the fear of God?

Luke 12

# Context

Jesus calls the Pharisees hypocrites because they live for the affirmation of
men. You cannot see God's grace in your life if you are hiding behind a
facade.

# Fearing God is a Commandment

This is troublesome for many because they see God as an angry person who
is never satisfied.

''(table ''["Misconception" "Reality"]
[
[ "Insensitive and uncaring" "Psalm 139 - kind and compassionate"]
[ "stern and demanding" "Accepting and filled with joy and love"]
[ "never satisfied with what I do" "He's patient and slow to anger"]
[ "controlling and manipulative" "Full of grace and mercy"]
[ "condemning and unforgiving" "Tenderhearted and forgiving"]
]
)''

Notice in Luke 12:4 Jesus says "My friends" because he loves us and treats us
as a friend. He is not intending to hurt us directly.

Eph 1:18 - hope (confidence) of His calling, glory of His inheritance in the
saints! I - the believer - is viewed as God's inheritance. 

Proverbs 9:10 

Fear - beginning of wisdom. In order to gain wisdom I have to step over the
threshold of fearing God.

Proverbs 10:27

Proverbs 26:27

Proverbs 14:26-27

Proverbs 19:23

Proverbs 22:4

Proverbs 31:30

_Fear is not to be your uniform emotional response to God_

If every time I think of God I have this petrified fear then I would have a
distorted image of God.

## What is The Fear Of God?

Fear is fear - it's a bad feeling.

Why should I feel this feeling? It is the proper response when you come into
contact with someone who has the unilateral power to bring negative affects
into your life.

Luke 12:4-5 We are to fear God because He is in control of our eternal destiny.

Psalm 47:2
Psalm 76:9

## Fear God Because He is In Control Of Our Daily Lives; Even Breath

Luke 12:5 - God has killed and can take us home after.

Hebrews 12:5,10

If God doesn't discipline you then you are not His son. 

# Application

The fear of God is not only for honoring got but is for our benefit

See to have a balance understanding of the fear of God
