<p>Romans 8:21</p>
<p>creation longs for God’s salvation.</p>
<p>In this season evangelical Christianity is at the height of this false teaching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An over-realized eschatology. If there is healing through the cross then we want health now; for by his stripes then we are healed. We should be able to name and claim our physical manifestation of God’s healing now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romans 8:23</p>
<p>We groan within ourselves for God’s adoptions as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</p>
<h2 id="realize-there-will-be-suffering">Realize There Will Be Suffering</h2>

<dd>we continue to groan (present active tense)

<p>Paul is saying: the Holy Spirit is the down payment for something to come.</p>
<p>I will give Israel a heart of flesh and take away their heart of stone. Before we came to Christ we had a heart of stone. If we have a heart of flesh then we should want holiness.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Righteousness</dt>
<dd>To want to do what is right; obey the commandments of the Lord. ; rightness
</dd>
<dd>Matthew 5 - “hunger and thirst for righteousness”
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We have a difficult time doing this; we have an old nature - a sin nature that draws us away from Christ to worldly things.</p>
<p>We physically don’t want to get up early in the morning doesn’t want to get out of bed and spend time with Christ. But the spirit planted in us does.</p>
<p>When we come to Christ God gives us a vacuous stomach and we long to eat. But to eat the hands (Holy Spirit) must move but the jaw (the flesh) does not open.</p>
<p>Romans 7:15</p>
<p>“Nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my [sin nature]”.</p>
<p>v21. “the law of God” = The holy spirit.</p>
<p>The body I have doesn’t want to cooperate with God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:15 “we’ve recieved the adoption as sons” but…Romans 8:21 - we’re waiting?</p>
<p>Adoption in the ancient world.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Patria potestas</dt>
<dd>the father had absolute control over their children. But up to a certain age they had a special ceremony. A robe the father placed on the child and he, the child, became a new person. He is now a man, a fellow heir with is father.

<p>Romans 8:17-18</p>
<h2 id="there-is-more-to-salvation">There is more to salvation</h2>
<p>We are completely saved when we trust Christ. But our bodies have not been redeemed. We await the realisation of this within our physical selves.</p>

<h2 id="god-back-to-the-future-for-strength">God Back To The Future For Strength</h2>
<p>Remember when you trusted Christ? You knew you did not want to spend eternity in Hell. The fact that Christ would love you and give you eternity was in comprehendable. He has eternity waiting for me! But over the years our flame grows cold. We start out with the future in mind; before long we forget we are to live with a mindset looking to the future. One day our body will be risen; our minds wholed; our hearts healed. Like a couple waiting for the wedding night; like a pregnant woman waiting to give birth. Are we like this? Do we live with anticipation? How we live here determines the blessing we get in the millenium.</p>
